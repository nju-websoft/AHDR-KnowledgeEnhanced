Nesting occurs primarily in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. The birds winter in the Central and Imperial Valleys of California as well as Arizona, Texas, and Mexico. Conversion of the mountain plovers\u2019 native grassland habitat to agricultural lands in both breeding and wintering areas has resulted in these birds using farmlands for feeding and roosting. Both the Central and Imperial Valleys report year round agriculture with over 809,400 ha (2 million acres) in production; but, these habitat preferences expose wintering mountain plovers to contaminants associated with agricultural practices, including current use pesticides and their adjuvants, persistent chemicals from historic applications, inorganic elements from irrigation drainwater, and chemicals present in the irrigation water. To evaluate the exposure of mountain plover to contaminants, we collected soil and food items at both their wintering and breeding grounds in 2006. We also collected eggs (2006-2008) to determine exposure of developing embryos to contaminants transferred by adults. Data from this study provides information on the contaminant exposure of young-of-the-year birds (as developing embryos and as nestlings) prior to their migration to the presumed more contaminated wintering grounds. Although, we did not specifically investigate nest success or embryo survival, it is possible that the elevated levels of some organic contaminants detected would affect chick survival or cause reproductive failure. A future study investigating reproductive success is warranted to answer this question."

Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

For example, the Federal Trade Commission staff report relied upon by Citizen Action actually concludes that variation in market shares \"is suggestive of a lack of coordination among majors\" in gasoline retailing. More recent studies by the EIA and DOE support the position that gasoline markets are competitive and that gasoline market prices respond to ordinary supply and demand factors unaffected by seller concentration. Mr. Tom Potter, Sr., testifying on behalf of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, concludes, \". . .the gasoline marketplace is exhibiting the normal characteristics of a free market premised on factors associated with supply and demand.\" At the core of the Citizen Action report is the hypothesis that higher than average gasoline prices are caused by higher than average seller concentration.

In the northeast, grassland and shrubland birds have been identified as habitat community groups showing the most widespread and persistent declines in abundance . Little attention has been focused on grassland bird recovery programs largely because of the idea that most grassland species are not native to the northeast but instead invaded it from western prairies after forests were cleared for agriculture. There is evidence prior to European settlement that open grassland and shrubland habitats such as meadows and croplands composed a significant proportion of the pre-European arrival landscape . In the Northeast, a shift in agricultural technology, farmland abandonment and movement to the west, more frequent haycropping rotations, loss of habitat, and an increase in human population has been cited as reasons for recent grassland bird declines. The objectives of the study were to: 1) compare breeding bird abundance (total and by species), diversity, and richness between idle hayfields and idle pastures; 2) relate composition and structure of vegetation of idle hayfields and pastures to grassland bird density, diversity, and richness; 3) determine nest fate of grassland bird species found on the refuge; 4) relate nest sites to composition and structure of vegetation on idle hayfields and pastures; and 5) develop management recommendations for the grasslands on the CVNWR."

For decades, landowners in the Iowa River floodplain responded to floods by repairing levees and fields, because no other options were available. But when the 1993 flood caused an estimated 6.9 million dollars in damages to land levees in the corridor, landowners responded enthusiastically to alternatives that would provide a permanent solution to chronic flood damage. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided an alternative to field and levee repair through the Emergency Wetland Reserve Program (EWRP). Through the EWRP, landowners with wet, flood-damaged crop ground were offered a one-time payment that was roughly equal to the value of their crop rights. In return, they agreed to grant a permanent easement and to restore their crop ground to its original wetland condition.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS, Service) evaluated the wildlife and recreational potential of the IRCP and agreed to buy the residual value of the land where landowners desired a total buyout. Lands acquired by the Service became part of the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS, Refuge System) managed under Port Louisa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR, Refuge) in Wapello, Iowa. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Service to manage these public lands as a state wildlife management area (WMA) on behalf of the Service (appendix A). The lands are therefore managed as part of the DNR\u2019s Iowa River Wildlife Unit.  An Environmental Assessment (EA) for land acquisition was completed in 1995 (FWS, 1995 ) and lands were subsequently acquired through the late 1990s. The acquisition boundary surrounds the floodplain area from just west of Tama, Iowa east to Amana, Iowa (figure 1-1). The authority for acquisition of these lands was the Emergency Wetland Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3901). The purposes of these refuge lands are therefore the conservation of the wetlands of the Nation in order to maintain the public benefits they provide and to help fulfill international obligations contained in various migratory bird treaties and conventions. The 1995 EA also outlines the purposes of:    \uf0b7 Providing habitat for migratory birds and endangered species.    \uf0b7 Improving the natural diversity of the ecosystem through restoration and protection of floodplain habitat.    \uf0b7 Providing an alternative to levee reconstruction and reclaiming damaged farmland.    \uf0b7 Increasing public opportunities for outdoor recreation, such as hunting or fishing, and environmental education compatible with the preceding purposes."

Russell (CMR) National Wildlife Refuge is in the final phases of completing its Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP). One of the primary components of the CCP\u2019s habitat objectives is the maintenance, restoration and promotion of naturally functioning ecological processes. Management for sharp\u2010tailed grouse was specified in the enabling language that established the refuge. Livestock grazing has impacted residual nesting cover for sharp\u2010tailed grouse and other grassland birds since the refuge was established and management of livestock grazing has been a major focus on the refuge. See Draft CMR CCP, Chapter 3, page 66, Objectives for Upland Habitat Alternative D: D1 \u2010 D9. The CCP recognizes that the impacts of all herbivory, or total ungulate use, is the basis for potential negative impacts to refuge resources. To better understand past grazing pressure and its possible impacts, a complete assessment of refuge and pasture fence boundaries and historic domestic cattle use in those pastures is needed. Current and future CMR management decisions are tied to those existing habitat unit boundaries and the cumulative effects of cattle grazing and other disturbances. This proposed project would fund a dedicated employee(s) to 1) complete the mapping of the remaining pastures and habitat units, 2) integrate the existing biological legacy data with the newly completed GIS layers, and 3) estimate annual grazing pressure/intensity in a spatially\u2010explicit manner from 1990 to present. This effort is the first component of a multiple\u2010step process the refuge is undertaking to integrate ongoing monitoring with management decisions. Currently, wildlife response to refuge management is monitored via spring grouse surveys and winter ungulate surveys (focal groups for CMR). Grouse surveys are conducted similar to Breeding Bird Surveys with survey points (n = 317) positioned along transects (n = 26) uniformly placed along refuge roads. These surveys have been conducted by refuge staff since 1990. Ungulate surveys have been conducted on 28 survey units since 2000. Integration of ongoing survey data and grazing management has been prevented due to 1) incomplete mapping of habitat units, 2) grazing histories are not linked to habitat unit spatial data, and 3) historic grazing intensity has not been predicted in a spatially\u2010explicit manner. The latter two issues need to be addressed in order to model the response of wildlife (grouse and ungulates) in a spatially\u2010explicit manner."

Only at refuges has wildlife conservation been legislated to have higher priority than either recreational or commercial activities. Presently, private ranchers and farmers graze cattle on 981,954 ha and harvest hay on 12.021 ha at 123 National Wildlife refuges. US Fish and Wildlife Service policy is to permit these uses primarily when needed to benefit refuge wildlife. to evaluate the success of this policy, I surveyed grassland management practices at 123 refuges. The survey results indicate that in fiscal year 1980 there were 374,849 animals unit months (AUMs)of cattle grazing, or 41% more than was reported by the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to the managers' opinions, 86 species of wildlife are positively affected and 82 are negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. However, quantitative field studies of the effect of cattle grazing or haying on wildlife coupled with the survey data on how refuge programs are implemented suggest that these activities are impeding the goal of wildlife conservation. Particular management problems uncovered by the survey include overgrazing of riparian habitats, wildlife mortality due to collisions with cattle fences, and mowing of migratory bird habitat during breeding season. Managers reported that they spend $919,740 administering cattle grazing and haying; thus refuge grazing and haying programs are also expensive. AT any single refuge these uses occupy up to 50% of refuge funds and 55% of staff time. In light of these results, prescribed burning may be a better wildlife management option than is either cattle grazing or haying."

Bacteria identified to the species level include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus sciuri, Serratia marcescens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Finegoldia magna. One hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected in all the life stages and tissues sampled. The total number of genera identified by tick sample comprised: 53 in adult males, 61 in adult females, 11 in gut tissue, 7 in ovarian tissue, and 54 in the eggs. Notable genera detected in the cattle tick include Wolbachia, Coxiella, and Borrelia. The molecular approach applied in this study allowed us to assess the relative abundance of the microbiota associated with R. microplus.    Ticks are regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild animals. The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical parts of the world where it is endemic. Tick microbiomes remain largely unexplored."

As such many of the ranch\u2019s native grasslands were seeded with non-native pasture grasses to increase the amount of forage available to livestock. Following USFWS acquisition of the ranch, all livestock grazing pressure was removed, leading to conditions favoring the development of monotypic stands of the previously seeded non-native grasses.  The vegetation communities in the refuge were mapped to support future restoration efforts of the native grassland. At the time of mapping many of the grasslands (>1500 ha) were considered to be part of the Palouse Prairie biome, even in this degraded state. The purpose of this research was to perform on-the-ground verification of the mapped community types, and to determine if in fact the grasslands within the refuge are representative of the Palouse Prairie."

They include Land Productivity, Phase I, and Phase II.  Productivity    As part of monitoring and evaluation activities, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and Millennium Challenge Account-Mongolia (MCA-M) carried out an impact evaluation that examined how the securing of long-term land use rights and provision of infrastructure and training through PURP affects not just livestock herding efficiency and productivity, but also environmental degradation and rangeland quality in peri-urban areas. In support of the rangeland quality component of the evaluation, MCC signed an agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Under this agreement, USDA provided technical advice and support to MCC regarding the monitoring and evaluation of pastureland and oversaw a local land quality contractor that carried out evaluation activities including the collection of baseline and follow-up data, as well as the training of local technicians and officials in sustainable land quality monitoring.  Methodology: Propensity Score Matching: Randomization  Phase 1    This study is an impact evaluation on the overall effect of the PURP on both project recipients and their neighbors. Key outcomes are household agricultural income, milk yields from cattle, and restriction of herd size to the carrying capacity of the land. A separate but coordinated study will examine the long term effect of the project on land degradation patterns. In Phase 1 areas, eligible applicants to the project went through an extensive screening process, including a requirement to obtain permission from all neighbor households, and all groups that passed through this process were admitted into the project. A comparison group was created through propensity score matching, using households from three populations: 1) applicants who did not pass the full screening process and so were rejected from the project, 2) neighbors of accepted and rejected groups, 3) a random sample of herder households from soums where the project was being implemented.  Methodology: Propensity Score Matching: Difference in Difference  Phase 2    This study is an impact evaluation on the overall effect of the PURP on both project recipients and their neighbors. Key outcomes are household agricultural income, milk yields from cattle, and restriction of herd size to the carrying capacity of the land. A separate but coordinated study will examine the long term effect of the project on land degradation patterns. In Phase 2 areas, eligible applicants to the project were entered into a lottery and half of them were randomly selected to become project beneficiaries. Thus a very clean control group was created to determine the causal impacts of the project.  Methodology: Randomization"

The bTEFAP method identified 16S rDNA sequences in our samples which allowed the identification of various prokaryotic taxa associated with the life stage examined. This is the first comprehensive report of bacterial flora associated with the horn fly using a culture-independent method. Several rumen, environmental, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria associated with the horn fly were identified and quantified. This is the first report of the presence of Wolbachia in horn flies of USA origin and is the first report of the presence of Rikenella in an obligatory blood feeding insect.    Adult horn flies were collected on a single date from pastured cattle at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, St. Gabriel Research Station using aerial nets. Within 1 h after collection the flies were transferred to large sterile Erlenmeyer flasks and maintained in total darkness for 1.5 h and 30\u00b0C to allow flies to oviposit on the flask bottom [73]. Adult flies were released from the flasks into a cage and eggs were collected by rinsing with distilled water onto a filter paper. Both the eggs and adult flies were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. To preserve nucleic acid integrity, adults were sexed on dry ice prior to freezing. Each sample used for DNA extraction and pyrosequencing consisted of 5 adult males, 5 adult females or 50 eggs pooled together and homogenized. Three replicates of adult male, adult female and eggs were analyzed.    The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is one of the most economically important pests of cattle. Insecticides have been a major element of horn fly management programs. Growing concerns with insecticide resistance, insecticide residues on farm products, and non-availability of new generation insecticides, are serious issues for the livestock industry. Alternative horn fly control methods offer the promise to decrease the use of insecticides and reduce the amount of insecticide residues on livestock products and give an impetus to the organic livestock farming segment. The horn fly, an obligatory blood feeder, requires the help of microflora to supply additional nutrients and metabolize the blood meal. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing methodologies enable researchers to examine the microflora diversity independent of culture methods."

The key species chosen for this study were the osprey, tricolored, great and little blue herons, and the snowy, great and cattle egrets. 2. The wading bird colonies at Upper Bird Key and Lower Bird Island (in Matlacha Pass) and the colony at Matanzas Pass proved to contain the species variety and, for the most part, numbers of nests that were desirable for this comparative study. 3. The late authorization of the Federal Collection Permit limited the number of osprey (and perhaps great blue heron) eggs that could be collected. 4. Broader geographic coverage of colonies throughout the Charlotte Harbor region would have been desirable, but the nesting of key species toward the center of most colonies in the northern part of the harbor made those nests unobservable. 5. Based on an inventory of active colonies in the Charlotte Harbor area, most survey data have been collected by the GFC and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Data are clustered around the periods 1976-1978 and 1986-1989. 6. Eggshell thicknesses for collected eggs are as follows, based on actual measurement (mm) and Ratcliffe's Index: tricolored heron - 0.228, 1.13 (n = 11); great blue heron - 0.489, 2.25 (n = 1); little blue heron - 0.216, 1.11 (n = 11); snowy egret - 0.206, 1.02 (n = 9); great egret - 0.279, 1.49 (n = 7); cattle egret - 0.216, 1.03 (n = 3); and osprey - 0.490, 2.44 (n = 2). Data for herons and egrets are broken down by colony in Table 7. 7. Early morning feeding flights during the nestling period were documented for the three colonies. An examination of those flights and an aerial inventory revealed that the subject wading birds (including the cattle egret) are likely to be feeding heavily in the flooded saltern habitat behind the mangroves and, to a lesser extent, the shallow open waters in front of the mangroves. Cattle egrets flew, of course, toward more upland habitats, but specific locations were not pursued. 8. A total of 40 eggs and 8 prey items were analyzed for Abate. Abate was not found in any sample above the detection limit of 0.05 u9/9 dry weight of sample."

Russell National Wildlife Refuge (CMR) received funds from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Region 6 Inventory and Monitoring program for the development of monitoring protocols to evaluate habitat management effects on CMR.  The focus of this effort was to improve refuge biologist\u2019s understanding of current monitoring efforts for Greater Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus), and select plant species that offer high forage value for wildlife.  These funds were spent through an Inter-Agency agreement with the United States Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center\u2019s Thomas Stanley.  Dr. Stanley evaluated existing monitoring techniques by conducting power analyses of pilot data sets within a Before-After Control-Impact experimental design framework (BACI).  These analyses included various scenarios of different sample sizes, significance levels (i.e., alpha values), time periods, and effect sizes.  This work was done to improve CMR\u2019s understanding of its current ability to detect management effects on priority resources and to help prepare CMR for evaluating management effects in the future.  CMR manages habitat primarily with herbivory and fire.  Herbivory management is a result of domestic livestock grazing, cattle, which ranges from annual grazing to no domestic grazing.  In addition to cattle, there is herbivory from wildlife that can be significant on CMR.  Fire management most often takes the form of wildfire suppression which ranges from aggressive suppression to non-action.  Fire management also includes prescriptive fire that is applied to achieve resource goals.   CMR has several priority resources; however, this work was limited to 3 focal areas as a result of their relevance to the refuge.  Greater Sage Grouse are a species of regional concern that occur on the refuge and their habitat makes up a significant component of CMR.  Sharp-tailed Grouse are a refuge priority resulting from the Executive Order that established this property.  High value forage plant species are included because of their ability to serve as indicator species for the general vegetative condition of an area.  By monitoring highly selected for forage species, it is assumed that when herbivory pressure becomes too intense and degrades plant communities, these sentinel or diagnostic plant species will be the first to show the effects."

The review and evaluation was conducted on October 18 and 19 with a written report completed mid December. The Review Team's report included the following recommendations on changes needed to enable the Refuge to meet its objectives through utilization of livestock as a means of manipulating vegetation: 1. Seeding pastures in some bottomland units to improve nesting cover for waterfowl and forage for cattle. 2. Approximately half of the bottomlands would be rested each year improving cover for upland nesting waterfowl. This would require a significant reduction in AUMs. 3. Combine upland and bottomland grazing units to reduce the number of cattle moves required. This would minimize stress placed on cattle. 4. Eliminate short duration grazing which has no validity within the context of winter dormancy. 5. Refuge Management should determine which units are grazed and rested. 6. Allow permittee flexibility to adjust stocking rates in grazed units."

Introduction    The Human Capital Project is one of three projects under the second compact, and it focuses on improving the quality of education and achieving a better match between the supply of skills and the demands of the labor market as they pertain to the international trade of goods and services in El Salvador. The Human Capital Project consists of two activities: (1) the Education Quality Activity, which is intended to improve the quality of the national education system; and (2) the Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) System Reform Activity. The TVET System Reform Activity, with funding of nearly $15 million, is intended to enhance its capacity to harmonize the skills supplied through education and training providers with the skills demanded by the labor market.     MCC contracted with Mathematica to conduct an evaluation of the activities under the Human Capital Project, including the TVET System Reform Activity. Mathematica will conduct a performance evaluation of the TVET System Reform Activity to document its implementation and assess how successful the project was at achieving the intended outcomes. Lessons learned through this performance evaluation will be useful for stakeholders as they continue improving the TVET system, and to inform decisions about the potential expansion of the reform activities to other sectors beyond the sectors focalized by FOMILENIO II.  II. Overview of the Technical  Education and Professional Training System  (TEPT) Activity The revised implementation of this Activity encompasses two main sub activities:     1. Integrated Technical Education and Professional Training Systems Sub-Activity: The revised implementation plan for this sub-activity includes two strategies:         a. Capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. The capacity building strategy has two goals: the first is to enable the private and public sector to identify and manage demands for technical education and professional training. The second is to enable public sector stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of education and training programs to respond quickly and efficiently to private sector labor market demands.     b. Strengthen the link between the supply and demand of technical education and professional training  through the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of information within and between productive sectors , and between private and public institutions in all productive sectors. FOMILENIO II will support the development of sectoral diagnostics to identify the needs of the productive sector, and improve the match between the industries and the training offerings in specified geographic areas. The following are the main tasks for implementing this strategy: 1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; 2) design or update three optional modules of the BTVs with input from the Sectoral Committees; and 3) Establish agreements between companies from the productive sectors and MINED to offer internships for students.    2. Continuous Labor Demand Assessment Sub-Activity. Two strategies encompass the implementation of this sub-activity: 1) establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework; and 2) strengthen the labor market observatory, integrating existing efforts to track labor market conditions.  III. Logic Model    The TEPT Activity in El Salvador is designed to link activities in the systems of technical education and professional training to the needs of the labor market in order to close the gap between training and employment. To that end, TEPT activities are largely focused on facilitating the exchange of information between the supply side and the demand side, both within and between productive sectors. The theory of change behind the implementation of the TEPT Activity states that all of its outputs will increase companies' productivity, and thereby improve workers' wages as well as the employability and socioeconomic standing of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.    1. Activities    The TEPT Activity funded by FOMILENIO II aims to strengthen capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. To that end, this strategy includes (1) creating sectoral committees for technical and educational training, and creating a Sectoral Committee Board to consolidate the demand for professional development in the private sector; (2) offering professional training to workers in the different industrial sectors under the competency-based approach; (3) designing models for certifying workers by competencies and accrediting institutions; (4) creating a Coordination Council of Technical Education and Professional Training to facilitate coordination between public and private organizations involved in technical and professional training, and align the offerings to the skills demanded in the labor market; and (5) establishing procedures and regulations to strengthen the institutional capacity to meet the private sector's demand for technical education and professional training. Implementation of the TEPT Activity includes the design of a roadmap for creating a national qualifications framework, and the development of an information system for the Coordination Council and other bodies to use in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the TEPT Activity.    The TEPT activity also seeks to improve the link between labor demand in the productive sectors with the availability of technical education and vocational training. To achieve this goal, FOMILENIO II plans to: (1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; (2) design at least three modules for the Vocational Technical Baccalaureate in coordination with the Sectoral Committees; and (3) establish agreements between companies from the sectors and MINEDUCYT to offer internships for students.     2. Short- and medium-term outcomes    Once the sectoral committees and the Board of Sectoral Committees are in existence, and a model for certification and accreditation has been implemented, the private sector will improve its capacity to identify and influence the professional training that is available to prospective trainees. Designing modules for the Professional Technical Baccalaureate, and creating the Coordination Council of TEPT will also improve the linkage between the demands of the productive sector, and the availability of technical education and vocational training.     3. Long-term outcomes    In the long term, the TEPT Activity is expected to improve the government's capacity to plan and evaluate the offer of technical education and professional training assisted by the MNC and the information system developed for subsequent planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the improved match between labor demand in the industrial/private sectors and the technical training available to the potential workforce will improve the productivity of companies, and therefore increase workers' wages. It is also expected to improve the employability of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.  IV. Evaluation design    The aims of the performance evaluation are to (1) assess progress toward the short- and medium-term outcomes that the program was designed to achieve and (2) understand and document the implementation of the Technical Education and Professional Training activities. To meet these two overarching aims, the performance evaluation will include a pre-post analysis of program outcomes and an implementation study.    A. Pre-post design.    The single group pre-post design consists of obtaining data for the outcomes of interest prior to (or at the beginning of) TEPT training (pre) and the same measure after participation in the TEPT courses (post). The pre-post study will focus on measuring the changes on labor market outcomes, and assessing to what extent work conditions, wages, and employment status improved for those who participated in the TEPT programs.     B. Implementation study     The implementation study will focus on describing all components of the TEPT program and their operation and identifying progress towards short- and medium-term outcomes of the program. We will document how program components were implemented, explore the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation of TEPT sub-activities, and describe the main program outputs of the TEPT System. We will also identify short- and long-term achievements and sustainability efforts related to each TEPT sub-activity.  V. Evaluation research questions    The pre-post study will focus on three descriptive research questions:    1. Did employee work conditions, benefits or non-wage compensation, change for trainees who participated in the TEPT courses approximately six to nine months after the courses ended?     2. Did wages change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    3. Did employment status change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    We will examine five main overarching research questions through the implementation study:    1. How were the TEPT sub-activities implemented, and what were the major facilitators and barriers to implementation?    2. Were some sectors more successful implementing the TEPT activities than others?    3. Which outputs were accomplished for each sub-activity, and to what extent did they meet the targets?     4. Which short- and long-term outcomes were accomplished for each sub-activity?     5. What are the plans for the institutional and financial sustainability of the services offered and the entities created as part of the TEPT activity?  VI. Data sources and analysis plan    A. Pre-post study:     Data sources.     The primary data source for the performance evaluation will be the trainee tracer survey. In collaboration with FOMILENIO II, we will field the pre-training tracer survey (baseline) with about 500 participants who are enrolled in TEPT courses, either prior to or within one month of their course initiation. TEPT courses will be rolled out starting the second quarter of 2019. Because the timing for the rollout will vary, baseline data collection will take place on a rolling basis and will be aligned with the course rollout plan for the prioritized sectors. We plan to conduct the baseline survey as a Computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ) with groups of enrolled trainees at their training sites and the follow-up survey as an individual, face-to-face, computer-administered questionnaire at respondents' work sites or homes. We will collect the follow-up survey six to nine months after the course ends by following a staggered timeline similar to the baseline data collection. The follow-up survey is expected to start in mid-2020 and to extend beyond the compact period.     Analyses.     To assess changes in work conditions, wages, and employment status sometime after participants should have completed the TEPT training programs, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the tracer survey data for trainees in FOMILENIO II-supported courses. We will compare key outcome indicators at baseline and follow-up for each trainee-level outcome and report averages (mean percent change) for the full sample of trainees and also by gender. We will also describe the background trainee characteristics, such as gender, age, and education level. The analysis will include a cross-sector comparison of participant characteristics and implementation milestones.    B. Implementation study    Data sources.     We will draw on three sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on outputs and achievements of the TEPT activity: (1) stakeholder interviews, (2) program monitoring data, and (3) a document review.     Analyses.     a. Analytic approach for quantitative program implementation data. We will conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on monitoring data to summarize the program outputs and understand short-term and long-term program achievements.    b. Analytic approach for qualitative program implementation data. We will prepare interview and focus group transcripts and conduct thematic analysis in two sequential steps. The first step involves conducting data reduction and mapping transcript segments to the core performance research questions. The second step involves thematic framing-the process of distilling themes and identifying patterns in qualitative data. We will develop a coding framework with a hierarchy of conceptual categories that are linked to the research questions and the program logic model. We will also create thematic memos for data synthesis and interpretation of key findings.     To take advantage of the complementarity that a mixed-methods approach affords, we will integrate findings from descriptive quantitative analysis of monitoring and administrative data with findings from qualitative data sources. We will summarize program outputs and outcomes from FOMILENIO II's administrative records and implementation reports by using data abstraction templates that we will design for this study. We will also create summary tables of qualitative findings from key stakeholder interviews. Then, we will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings by using triangulation techniques to (1) assess the consistency of the findings across methods and data sources, (2) confirm patterns of findings, and (3) identify potential discrepancies across data sources. Furthermore, information from the qualitative data collection related to barriers and facilitators to program implementation will help us interpret the findings from the quantitative analysis."

(2) What was the impact of the program on test scores?     (3) Were the impacts different for girls than for boys?   In this particular case, to estimate the program\u2019s impacts, we assessed how children in BRIGHT villages fared relative to how they would have fared had BRIGHT not been implemented. This assessment is important because even in the absence of BRIGHT, it is likely that enrollment would have increased in the 132 villages in which it was implemented. School construction and enrollment both were increasing in the period prior to the implementation of BRIGHT, and the government of Burkina Faso launched a program, Plan Decennal de Developpement de l\u2019Education de Base (PDDEB) for the period 2002-2011 PDDEB\u2019s goals include increased access to schooling and the promotion of girls\u2019 education. Moreover, during 2007\u20132008, the total number of children enrolled in school rose in the 10 provinces in which BRIGHT was implemented\u2014in the 132 BRIGHT villages and the remaining villages as well.   Hence, our ability to assess the program\u2019s success turns on the issue of whether, and the extent to which, we can ascertain what part of the improvement in educational outcomes in the 132 BRIGHT villages was due to the program itself and what part would have happened even if the program had not been implemented.  Summary of Results    In general, the main conclusions are that BRIGHT had about a 20 percentage point positive impact on girls\u2019 primary school enrollment, and had positive impacts on Math and French test scores for both girls and boys.  The evaluator was unable to separately estimate the impact of each component of the intervention (schools, textbooks, etc.)"

IMAGINE follow-up data were collected in 2011. NECS Wave 1 data (which were also used to estimate longer term impacts of IMAGINE) were collected in 2013.   After one year (using the data collected in 2011) the Impact Evaluation of Niger's IMAGINE program found that IMAGINE had a 4.3 percentage point positive impact on primary school enrollment, no impact on attendance, and no impact on math and French test scores. The program impacts were generally larger for girls than for boys. For girls, the program had an 8 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a 5.4 percentage point impact on attendance. The program had no impact on girls\u2019 math scores, though there is suggestive evidence it may have had a positive impact of 0.09 standard deviations on girls\u2019 French test scores. No significant impacts were detected for boys\u2019 enrollment, attendance, or test scores. Finally, impacts were larger for younger children (ages 7-10), than for those between the ages of 10 and 12.  After four years (using data collected in 2013 during the NECS Wave 1 data collection), the Niger IMAGINE Long-Term Evaluation found that IMAGINE had a 8.3 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a  7.9 percentage point negative impact on absenteeism.  On average, children in treatment villages scored 0.13 standard deviations higher on the math assessment than children in control villages (significant at the 5 percent level). Test scores in French for children in treatment villages were higher than in control villages, but were not statistically significant. The evaluation found  large and significant impacts of the program on enrollment, attendance, and math scores for females,    compared to more modest and less significant impacts for males."

Mathematica will compare data collected from the 132 communities served by BRIGHT II (the \"treatment group\") with that collected from the 161 communities that applied but were not selected for the program (the \"comparison group\"). Using a statistical technique called regression discontinuity, Mathematica will compare the outcomes of the treatment villages just above the cutoff point to the outcomes of the comparison villages just below the cutoff point. If the intervention had an impact, we will observe a \"jump\" in outcomes at the point of discontinuity.   Mathematica will perform additional analyses to estimate the overall merit of the BRIGHT investment. By conducting a cost-benefit analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis and calculating the economic rate of return, Mathematica will be able to answer questions related to the sustainability of the program, and compare the program to interventions and social investments in other sectors. The household survey is designed to capture household-level data rather than community-level data; however, questions have been included to measure head-of-household expectations of educational attainment. These questions ask the head of household what grade level he hopes each child will attain; and what grade level he thinks the child will be capable of achieving in reality."

                "text": "El Salvador - Formal Technical Education With a budget of nearly $20 million, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was designed to strengthen technical and vocational educational institutions in the Northern Zone of El Salvador. By improving schools and offering scholarships, the sub-activity financed efforts to increase youths' access to high-quality technical education in the region, thus increasing their achievement levels, secondary (and post-secondary) school graduation rates, and prospects for gainful employment. By 2012, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was scheduled to invest $3.8 million in scholarships for students enrolled in secondary and post-secondary technical schools in the Northern Zone. According to preliminary budgets, the sub-activity would also provide $9 million to improve 20 technical secondary schools in the Northern Zone with infrastructure investments and additional teacher training programs. In addition, the sub-activity was scheduled to invest $7 million to strengthen ITCHA, an existing post-secondary institute in the Northern Zone.   In conducting the evaluation of the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity-which includes secondary and post-secondary school improvements and scholarships-Mathematica will address the following research questions regarding Sub-Activity investments from 2009 to 2012:   1.Program design/implementation. How were the secondary school strengthening and scholarship programs, and the ITCHA strengthening program designed and implemented? Did implementation meet original targets and expectations? Why or why not?  2.Description of participants. What are the characteristics (age, gender, initial household income, etc.) of scholarship recipients? What are the basic characteristics of secondary school and ITCHA students?   3.Impact/Results. What is the impact of FOMILENIO's strengthening secondary school program on students' education and labor market outcomes, including secondary school enrollment, grade completion, graduation, and further education, employment, and income? What is the impact of the offer of scholarships in some programs within strengthened schools on student educational and labor outcomes? Did ITCHA graduates obtain jobs and experience increased income following graduation? Did ITCHA students who graduated from secondary school MEGATEC programs have better academic and labor market outcomes than students who did not attend secondary school MEGATEC programs?  4.Impacts/Results by key target subgroups. Were impacts/results different for girls versus boys? What types of participants experienced positive impacts?  5.Explanation for impact findings and results. What was the ex-post statistical power, and can this explain the lack of impacts (in cases where no impacts are found)? What aspects of implementation could explain the impacts/results? If impacts/results were different for girls versus boys, why?  6.Sustainability. Are secondary school improvements and scholarships being maintained? Are ITCHA improvements being maintained? Are they likely to be maintained in the medium to long term?   To answer all research questions regarding the design, implementation, and sustainability of the strengthening efforts and scholarships (Topics 1, 2, 5, and 6), Matheatica will use a mixed-methods evaluation design that uses qualitative and quantitative methods (see Table III.1). With this approach, researchers will use qualitative methods-namely, qualitative interview data and programmatic reports-to help understand processes and activities, provide information on setting or context, and communicate the perspectives and experiences of key participants through direct quotes. In addition, Mathematica will use quantitative information on program outputs and costs, participant characteristics, and budget outlays to summarize the intervention, describe its participants, and analyze the sustainability of its original investments.   To answer research questions regarding impacts and results (3, 4, and 5), Mathematica will use a variety of designs. To determine the impact of secondary school scholarships, researchers designed and implemented a random assignment design, by which some eligible applicants were randomly selected to receive scholarships. To determine the impact of secondary school strengthening investments, Mathematica designed and implemented a matched comparison group approach using propensity score methods, by which students at the 20 strengthened schools are compared to students at 20 similar non-strengthened schools. Finally, to measure key results of the ITCHA intervention-including graduation and employment rates-researchers used a mixed-methods approach that featured a follow-up survey of ITCHA students.   All impact and results analyses rely on in-person surveys, including panel surveys of scholarship applicants, cross-sectional baseline and follow-up surveys of secondary school students, and a follow-up survey of ITCHA students."

Within the three Refuge lakes, Mary, Ladora, and Derby, various species of fish occur. Though the lakes are stocked annually, providing fish with more cover through habitat improvement projects will help maintain the population. This has been observed from the recreational fishing program creel for both Lake Mary and Ladora. While fishing is not allowed in Lower Derby at the present time, it is important to maintain fish populations for both carp control and to attract waterfowl. Using structures to improve habitat is a method used by many agencies and private landowners. There are various ways to construct and successfully implement structures. Mississippi State University (MSU) started a Coordinated Access to the Research and Extension System service, also known as MSU CARES, to help aid Mississippi farm ponds offer excellent fishing for public use. The service provides examples of various different fish attractors including those built using either trees or gravel beds. The University of Georgia created a leaflet on building fish structures out of brush, tires, and Christmas trees. Studies conducted by universities, private research facilities, and state and government agencies show the effectiveness of fish structures in increasing fish harvest (Brunson 2002). Fish structures, especially in lakes with little vegetation and natural cover, give young and adult fish protective cover (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-USACE). In these structures, fish can hide from predators, but they also give predators a place to find food (Brunson 2002). Tree structures, unlike other structures, serve for more than just cover. Over time, these structures will begin to decompose and helps produce phytoplankton, zooplankton and algae which will feed the smaller fish (USACE).  The addition of several trees, antler sheds, and fencing structures into Lower Derby Lake would benefit fish, their predators, and the aquatic community as a whole. The structures will help ensure that RMANWR fish populations continue to grow at a healthy rate. Most importantly, the structures will provide fish with cover from predators, hunting areas for predators, and spawning habitat."

The Sub-Activity funded short-term courses in common trades such as baking, bricklaying, and electrical installations. The short-term goal of the non-formal skills program was to increase the education and skill levels of at-risk populations in the Northern Zone.  The medium-term goals were to decrease economic barriers to labor force entry, while increasing the personal income, labor market participation, and self-employment rates of vulnerable populations. Lastly, the program's long-term goal was to spur economic growth and reduce poverty in the target area.     To examine the effects of the Non-Formal Skills Development Sub-Activity on employment rates and personal income, we used a pre-post survey design. With this design, we compare outcomes of enrolled participants before the start of the program with the outcomes of the same individuals approximately one year after the end of the program. This design cannot fully attribute before-after differences to the training program because other factors outside of the program-including broader economic developments during the study period-could have also affected participants' outcomes. Although we do not report impact estimates, or estimates that are fully attributable to the program, this analysis can offer valuable insight regarding the following research question:  \u00b7What was the change in participants' labor market outcomes and income approximately one year after completing a 180-400 hour non-formal skills course?"

This report only addresses data obtained in the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge and the Northern Unit of the Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, currently under management by Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge staff. Valuable baseline water quality and contaminants data were obtained for performing before/after comparisons should mining resume on the drainages sampled. Study sites resembled many other nonglacial interior Alaska streams and rivers -- slightly acid to moderately basic in pH, soft to moderate in hardness, and low to average in alkalinity. All sites except the Hogatza River and the Koyukuk River had low turbidities for rivers. Measurable settlable solids were observed in the Koyukuk River and in Caribou Creek, and comparatively high suspended solids were measured in the Hogatza River, Koyukuk River, and Caribou Creek in 1987. Caribou Creek's turbidity was only slightly elevated and Clear Creek was very low in turbidity, indicating that the source of turbidity on the Hogatza River was being derived from other sources at the time of sampling, and not directly from these formerly mined streams. The comparatively high turbidity, settleable solids, and suspended of these rivers in 1987 was not observed in 1988, suggesting that the higher turbidity may occur episodically, following flood events. With a few notable exceptions, surface waters examined in this study were relatively uncontaminated by metals. Vanadium concentrations in refuge surface waters were observed only in 1986 in single grab samples and appear elevated (> 0.01 mg/L) at the Hogatza River, Bishop Creek, and the Gisasa River. Other metals elevated in water are iron, manganese, copper, and nickel. Sufficient northern pike were obtained for trace element analysis and statistical treatment from all study sites except Clear Creek, where only Arctic grayling were obtained. Barium, cadmium, chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium were present in some fish livers, while copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, tin and zinc were present in all fish livers. The relationship between fish growth and site was also investigated. No significant differences in northern pike length, weight, or condition index occurred among sites. Also, correlations between northern pike length, weight, and condition index and trace element concentrations, when observed, appeared weak and unlikely to strongly influence fish growth or condition. One unfortunate casualty of our quality control/quality assurance screening was mercury in all three media -- water, sediments, and fish tissues. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that, according to analytical results, mercury was present in fish muscle tissue, as well as other tissues, sometimes at concentrations probably equally to or greater than 1 mg/kg wet weight. Concern therefore remains that certain watersheds on these refuges contain mercury contaminated fish that present a possible health hazard to fish, wildlife, and subsistence users, particularly if use of northern pike is frequent in areas where mercury concentrations are high. Until quality data are obtained for mercury and source areas of mercury are better defined, the amount of risk from mercury in fish from these watersheds remains uncertain."

The area is being considered for seismic oil exploration activities scheduled to begin in December 1982. A colored land cover map of the study area at 1:250,000 scale was derived from Landsat data as part of this project and was used extensively in the terrain analysis. Descriptions of the environment are based on a seven-day reconnaissance trip in August 1981 that concentrated in four townships of the study area. The field data are supplemented with information from 1 :60,000-scale, color-infrared and 1: 18,000-scale, color aerial photographs. The report is divided into two parts. The first describes the Landsat map, the methods for making it, and the legend. The second is a description of the ANWR study area based on the major terrain types. The Landsat-derived land cover map consists of a digital mosaic of portions of three Landsat scenes. The land cover classification consists of the following map categories: 1) Water, 2) Pond/Sedge Tundra Complex or Aquatic Tundra or shallow water, 3) Wet Sedge Tundra, 4) Moist/Wet Sedge Tundra Complex or Dry Prostrate Shrub, Forb Tundra, 5) Moist Sedge, Prostrate Shrub Tundra or Moist Sedge/Barren Tundra Complex (frost-scar tundra), 6) Moist Sedge Tussock, Dwarf Shrub Tundra, 7) Moist Dwarf Shrub, Sedge Tussock Tundra or Moist Sedge Tussock, Dwarf Shrub/Wet Dwarf Shrub Complex (water track complex), 8) Shrub Tundra, 9) Partially vegetated areas, 10) Barren gravel or rock, 11) Wet gravel or mud, and 12) Ice. The land cover classification system is briefly explained and equivalent units are given for six other vegetation, wetland and land cover classification systems. The legend system is a solution to the current need for a tundra classification. The system is still being perfected, but it already meets the following criteria: 1) The system is applicable to both large- and small-scale mapping. 2) It consistently applies the same criteria to naming all community types. 3) It has a consistent method of naming vegetation complexes. 4) It is well suited for specific application to Landsat multispectral scanner data. The study area is divided into five terrain types and the ocean. These types delineate relatively large areas with similar primary landforms. They are, with their percentage of the study area in parentheses, foothills (44.7%), river flood plains (24.60%), hilly coastal plains (22.4%), ocean (5.20Jo%), flat thaw-lake plains (3.10%) and mountainous terrain (0.03%). Foothills are the most common terrain type in the study area. Tundra with sedge tussocks and dwarf shrubs covers most foothill uplands. Dominant plants include sheathed cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum), numerous ericaceous shrubs, dwarf birch (Betula nana) and diamond-leafed willow (Salix planifolia ssp. pulchra). Shrub cover varies in upland tundra types and is responsible for much of the variation in spectral reflectances from moist tundra vegetation. Stream valleys, southfacing slopes and water tracks (drainage channels on slopes) are likely to have welldeveloped shrub communities. Frost scars occur on most upland surfaces and may cover up to 900Jo of the surface. Pergelic Cryaquolls or Pergelic Cryaquepts underlie much of the moist tundra, although Histic Pergelic Cryaquepts are common soils in water tracks. River flood plains, which cover large portions of the study area, are highly complex landscapes that include present flood plains, former braided drainages, river deltas, bluffs, terraces, wet tundra, gravel bars, dunes, mud flats and river icings."

Seedlings from the Dismal Swamp were subjected to three flood treatments (no flooding, intermittent flooding, and continuous flooding) and four enrichment treatments (no enrichment, N additions, P additions, and N + P additions). More continuous flooding resulted in less biomass production. Biomass increased during the study in all treatments except for root mass in the continuously flooded treatment. However, production of abundant adventitious roots compensated for the lack of normal root growth. Root/ shoot ratios exhibited the greatest decreases in the continuously flooded plants. Plants with N + P added had significantly more leaf, stem, and total mass than the nonenriched plants four months into the study. The N + P additions had apparently compensated for the effects of flood stress in the continuously flooded plants by the end of the study. The fertilized seedlings accumulated higher concentrations of N and P, but their nutrient use efficiency (biomass production per unit nutrient absorbed) was lower than in the nonenriched plants. Acer rubrum seedlings survive flooded conditions through several adaptations; however, their growth is slowed    by continuous flooding."

The predominant feature of the Pensacola Hydroelectric Project is Pensacola Dam, which impounds Grand Lake O\u2019 the Cherokees (locally called Grand Lake) in northeastern Oklahoma. Identification of information gaps and assessment of project effects on stakeholders are central aspects of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relicensing process. Some upstream stakeholders have expressed concerns about the dynamics of sedimentation and flood flows in the transition zone between major rivers and Grand Lake O\u2019 the Cherokees. To relicense the Pensacola Hydroelectric Project with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the hydraulic models for these rivers require high-resolution bathymetric data along the river channels. In support of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relicensing process, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Grand River Dam Authority, performed bathymetric surveys of (1) the Neosho River from the Oklahoma border to the U.S. Highway 60 bridge at Twin Bridges State Park, (2) the Spring River from the Oklahoma border to the U.S. Highway 60 bridge at Twin Bridges State Park, and (3) the Elk River from Noel, Missouri, to the Oklahoma State Highway 10 bridge near Grove, Oklahoma. The Neosho River and Spring River bathymetric surveys were performed from October 26 to December 14, 2016; the Elk River bathymetric survey was performed from February 27 to March 21, 2017. Only areas inundated during those periods were surveyed. The bathymetric surveys covered a total distance of about 76 river miles and a total area of about 5 square miles. Greater than 1.4 million bathymetric-survey data points were used in the computation and interpolation of bathymetric-survey digital elevation models and derived contours at 1-foot intervals. The minimum bathymetric-survey elevation of the Neosho River was 709.18 feet above North American Vertical Datum of 1988, which corresponds to a maximum depth of 34.22 feet. The minimum bathymetric-survey elevation of the Spring River was 714.18 feet above North American Vertical Datum of 1988, which corresponds to a maximum depth of 29.22 feet. The minimum bathymetric-survey elevation of the Elk River was 715.62 feet above North American Vertical Datum of 1988, which corresponds to a maximum depth of 27.78 feet."

For decades, landowners in the Iowa River floodplain responded to floods by repairing levees and fields, because no other options were available. But when the 1993 flood caused an estimated 6.9 million dollars in damages to land levees in the corridor, landowners responded enthusiastically to alternatives that would provide a permanent solution to chronic flood damage. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided an alternative to field and levee repair through the Emergency Wetland Reserve Program (EWRP). Through the EWRP, landowners with wet, flood-damaged crop ground were offered a one-time payment that was roughly equal to the value of their crop rights. In return, they agreed to grant a permanent easement and to restore their crop ground to its original wetland condition.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS, Service) evaluated the wildlife and recreational potential of the IRCP and agreed to buy the residual value of the land where landowners desired a total buyout. Lands acquired by the Service became part of the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS, Refuge System) managed under Port Louisa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR, Refuge) in Wapello, Iowa. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Service to manage these public lands as a state wildlife management area (WMA) on behalf of the Service (appendix A). The lands are therefore managed as part of the DNR\u2019s Iowa River Wildlife Unit.  An Environmental Assessment (EA) for land acquisition was completed in 1995 (FWS, 1995 ) and lands were subsequently acquired through the late 1990s. The acquisition boundary surrounds the floodplain area from just west of Tama, Iowa east to Amana, Iowa (figure 1-1). The authority for acquisition of these lands was the Emergency Wetland Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3901). The purposes of these refuge lands are therefore the conservation of the wetlands of the Nation in order to maintain the public benefits they provide and to help fulfill international obligations contained in various migratory bird treaties and conventions. The 1995 EA also outlines the purposes of:    \uf0b7 Providing habitat for migratory birds and endangered species.    \uf0b7 Improving the natural diversity of the ecosystem through restoration and protection of floodplain habitat.    \uf0b7 Providing an alternative to levee reconstruction and reclaiming damaged farmland.    \uf0b7 Increasing public opportunities for outdoor recreation, such as hunting or fishing, and environmental education compatible with the preceding purposes."

Significant continental-scale loss and degredation of wetlands led to establishment of some of the regions\u2019 largest wetland complexes as National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) (e.g., Benton Lake, Malheur, and Red Rock Lakes NWRs) and state    Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) (e.g., Farmington Bay, Freezeout Lake, and Market Lake WMAs).  Wetland management actions often mimic natural disturbance processes in order to maintain ecological function in modified systems. Objectives for semi-permanently flooded wetland habitats within these regions typically focus on one of the two following approaches to management: 1) managing for wetland function to provide a desired plant community, or 2) managing to provide habitat for a specified population size and/or life-history requirement(s) of    focal wildlife species. For example, sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), a pioneering wetland plant species, is more nutritious and often more preferred by herbivorous migratory birds than species more tolerant of anoxic conditions such as shortspike watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). Hence, management objectives for semi-permanently flooded wetlands often include maintaining a relatively high abundance of sago pondweed for the benefit of migratory birds.  The primary disturbance process of management interest in semi-permanently flooded wetland habitats is the dynamic wet/dry hydrological cycle, which is a key driver of wetland productivity and vegetation community structure. Water level changes (either managed or natural) are perterbations that influence nutrient turnover rates, vegetation, aquatic    invertebrates, and resource availability for wetland-dependent wildlife. Wetland systems can respond to perturbations in a non-linear fashion with multiple \u2018equilibrial\u2019 states, and more ephemeral vegetation community phases within states, possible. The frequency, timing, and duration of drawdowns (natural or managed) are important factors in determining which vegetation community phases are expressed within a semi-permanently flooded wetland area. The ability to predict the response of vegetation to water level changes varies depending on the knowledge of the wetland system being managed and life history characteristics of plants.  The first component of this project is to build a common management framework for semipermanently flooded wetland habitats across the three regions. The framework will incorporate ecological processes, and site and management potentials, to define a range of states and vegetation community phases within states."

This network of wetlands, forests, and grasslands has also provided habitat for a variety of fish and resident wildlife species. The Upper Mississippi River (UMR)    floodplain has been greatly altered for agriculture, urbanization, navigation and flood control. The quantity and quality of wildlife habitat on the River has declined. We believe that partnerships will play a key role in achieving the long-term ecological integrity of the UMR.  Cooperative working relationships between federal and state agencies, industry, and the public are crucial to achieving a balance between commercial navigation, recreation, River habitat for wildlife and safe municipal water. Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge Complex (Complex) lands will contribute to larger public policy goals regarding floodplain management. Research and monitoring data must be current, readily available, and applicable to land management decision-making needs. In the future, the Complex management program on 500 miles of the UMR will be an exemplary model for partnerships and science-based wildlife management.  The River will provide a mosaic of habitats to sustain healthy populations of native wildlife. Managed lands, such as those within the Complex, have become critical for the ecological sustainability of the UMR. A balanced program of habitat protection, enhancement, and restoration will consider overall habitat needs on the pool, reach, and watershed levels. The Complex will provide high-quality habitat along the UMR for migratory birds, other wildlife species, and fish. Management programs will be effectively monitored for success and adapted and modified as new scientific information becomes available.  While wildlife management remains the primary purpose of the Refuge Complex, compatible public use and enjoyment of those resources is also important. The Complex will provide an array of environmental and wildlife education programs and wildlife dependent recreational activities. Habitat management programs and public use facilities will attract thousands of visitors annually. The partnership with the Army Corps of Engineers involving the Riverlands Project Area provides an opportunity for conducting a quality off-refuge wildlife education and interpretation program within a large metropolitan area. Local communities will appreciate the role of the Service in managing quality wildlife habitat and contributing to improved floodplain factors such as flood water storage and helping to provide for clean, safe water in the River corridor."

These mats can displace most native vegetation in infestation areas, significantly degrading native habitats and altering stream and shoreline hydrology, negatively impacting habitat quality for numerous species of migratory waterfowl, secretive waterbirds, other migratory birds and native salmonids. Yellow-flag iris is a Class \u201cC\u201d noxious weed in Washington State, and Class \u201cB\u201d designated in Oregon.Yellow-flag iris was first noticed on McNary NWR in ~2009 in two small (<10\u2019) patches in a moist soil management unit. By 2011 it had shown up in 4 other disparate areas in two other management units and now covers ~2 acres of riparian habitats within ~80 acres. The original source of the infestation is unknown, but is believed to have originated from seed. No other significant infestations are known to be nearby upstream of the refuge on any of the three rivers crossing the refuge. Yellow-flag iris was first noticed on Toppenish NWR in ~2010. In 2012, numerous small patches were seen in many of the marsh units of the refuge, covering ~5 acres within ~2,000 acres of impoundments. No infestation source is known to be upstream of the refuge. It is believed to have been brought in by wildlife during flooding events in 2009 and 2010 from infestations downstream of the refuge (in the Yakima River drainage) and/or from ornamental plantings. Treatments in 2013 and 2014 resulted in reductions of area infested. Reduced efforts in 2015 due to inadequate staffing allowed remaining populations to expand at some sites.The proposed project will reduce yellow-flag iris infestations on both refuges and limit further spread. Known infestations will be targeted for chemical application (aquatic-labeled glyphosate @ 5-8% solution, with aquatic-labeled surfactant/penetrant) and/or manual removal where necessary (e.g., small, isolated infestations or individual plants growing with sensitive native vegetation). The remaining susceptible areas of the Refuges will be systematically inspected for additional occurrences, and any found plants will be treated and/or removed."

The study goal was to provide information necessary for resource managers to develop management strategies for this and other units of the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge. Researchers studied the hydrology, limnology, and biological dynamics of zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, fish and waterbird communities. Lisbon Bottom is one of several parcels of 1993 flood-damaged land that was purchased from willing sellers by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge. Lisbon Bottom is a loop bend in the river near Glasgow in Howard County, Missouri between approximately river mile (RM) 213 to RM 219. Flooding at Lisbon in 1993 and 1995 breeched local levees and created a diverse wetland complex."

We evaluated the importance of this grit site to light geese in southwest Louisiana from 1 November 2001 to 10 February 2004. Specifically, we estimated:(1) distances flown to the grit site by snow geese from other parts of southwest Louisiana; (2) return probabilities to the grit site of snow geese neck-banded at CPNWR; (3) whether male and female snow geese used the grit site similarly; and (4) the ratio of Ross's geese to snow geese at the grit site, compared to elsewhere in our study area, by using a likelihood-ratio test.   We neck-banded 414 snow geese at CPNWR in winters 2001-2002,2002-2003, and 2003-2004. Snow geese banded at CPNWR regularly used rice-fields near Sweet Lake(10-15 km north of CPNWR) and Thornwell(30-60 km of CPNWR); a few individuals were observed further west or east and southeast of CPNWR. Return probabilities to the grit site from Sweet Lake were 0.39 and 0.19 for male and female snow geese, respectively; return probabilities from Thornwell were 0.14 and 0.08 for males and females, respectively. Ross's geese used CPNWR in proportion to their abundance elsewhere in study area. Our results indicate that: (1) the grit site at CPNWR is used by snow geese from all over southwest Louisiana; (2) snow geese frequently fly distances up to 60 miles to use the grit site; (3) Ross's geese are equally likely to use the grit site as are snow geese."

This data set provides a Climate Data Record (CDR) of passive microwave sea ice concentration based on the recommendations from the National Research Council (NRC) (2004). It is produced from gridded brightness temperatures from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave radiometers: F-8, F-11, and F-13. The NOAA/NSIDC CDR sea ice concentrations provide a consistent, daily time series of sea ice concentrations from 09 July 1987 through 31 December 2007. The NOAA/NSIDC CDR sea ice concentrations are an estimate of the fraction of ocean area covered by sea ice that is produced by combining concentration estimates created using two algorithms developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC): the NASA Team algorithm (Cavalieri et al., 1984) and the Bootstrap algorithm (Comiso, 1986). The individual algorithms are processed and combined at NSIDC using brightness temperature data from Remote Sensing Systems, Inc. (RSS). The data are gridded on the NSIDC polar stereographic grid with 25 x 25 km grid cells and are available in netCDF file format. Each daily file includes four different sea ice concentration variables: a variable with the primary CDR sea ice concentrations created by NSIDC and three variables with sea ice concentrations created by Goddard. The three Goddard-processed sea ice concentrations are Goddard NASA Team algorithm sea ice concentrations, Goddard Bootstrap sea ice concentrations, and a merged version of the Goddard NASA Team/Bootstrap algorithm sea ice concentrations. Variables containing standard deviation, quality flags, and projection information are also included in the netCDF file. The three Goddard-produced sea ice concentrations are included in the data files for a number of reasons. The merged Goddard NASA Team/Bootstrap sea ice concentrations are an ancillary data set that is analogous to the NSIDC CDR data but that adds late 1978 through mid 1986 data to the record. A different instrument, the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), was the source for the brightness temperatures from this period. Sea ice concentrations from the extended period are not part of the primary NSIDC-produced CDR record because complete documentation of the SMMR brightness temperature processing method is not available. The separate Goddard NASA Team and Bootstrap sea ice concentrations are provided for reference. The data are available via FTP."

Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

This report gives an overview of events taking place on the refuge in April of 1938. A cold snap hit the refuge early in the month. Waterfowl were fed several barrels of grain daily. Water levels and precipitation are still low. Promised water released from the Upper Souris was never received due to the powers that control the Eaton project. Large numbers of nesting have occurring, even in the goose pen. Food crop planting took place, with over 107 acres planted with Duram Wheat and Sweet Clover. A share-cropping program has been approved to try out. This program will reduce the work load of the refuge staff. Predator control operations have almost been discontinued during the month of April.

Invasive plants, particularly smooth brome, Kentucky bluegrass and weedy forbs (e.g., leafy spurge, Canada thistle, sweet clover) pose an imminent, widespread threat to biodiversity of these prairies. Restoration of prairies is an explicit goal within Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs) for the SRB NWRs and J. Clark Salyer Wetland Management District (WMD). Additionally, conservation and restoration of native prairie is a 2012 Regional Resource Priority (RD\u2019s Memo 11/2011); covers two of the National Priorities in the Strategic Plan for Inventories and Monitoring on National Wildlife Refuges: Adapting to Environmental Change (2010), including baseline inventory of biota (vegetation) and supporting adaptive management at refuge and landscape scales; and Plains and Prairie Potholes LCC priority number two, developing information that can assist in the conservation and restoration of landscapes capable of maintaining ecological services. Plant composition was inventoried for all prairie tracts within the SRB Complex during 2001\u20102004. Based on these inventories, coupled with 20 years of applied research, prairie tracts were prioritized by the probability of successful restoration. High priority tracts have better floristic composition, are larger, and/or are adjacent to other USFWS prairies or private pastures. Restoration\u2010based objectives were then developed for high\u2010priority prairies (grouped by habitat type) within the complex. Restoration objectives are specific, measurable, and realistic (e.g., see Chapter 4, USFWS 2007). Following principals of adaptive management, high priority tracts require periodic assessment of progress in attaining stated objectives, and where necessary adjusting those objectives. Monitoring intervals of 5\u201010 years were identified in CCPs (see Science Objectives, USFWS 2007). Herein we request support for completing the first comprehensive monitoring cycle for prairies within the SRB Complex. Results will be utilized to determine if and how prairie plant communities have changed since original inventories. Results have implication for nearly all NWR complexes in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Northeast Montana."

For example, the Federal Trade Commission staff report relied upon by Citizen Action actually concludes that variation in market shares \"is suggestive of a lack of coordination among majors\" in gasoline retailing. More recent studies by the EIA and DOE support the position that gasoline markets are competitive and that gasoline market prices respond to ordinary supply and demand factors unaffected by seller concentration. Mr. Tom Potter, Sr., testifying on behalf of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, concludes, \". . .the gasoline marketplace is exhibiting the normal characteristics of a free market premised on factors associated with supply and demand.\" At the core of the Citizen Action report is the hypothesis that higher than average gasoline prices are caused by higher than average seller concentration. Many numbers are presented, but Citizen Action provides no systematic analysis of the data. Their approach is a series of ad hoc pairwise comparisons. Multiple regression allows us to analyze the complete  data set and to introduce the effects of other factors such as the costs of doing business in different geographic areas."

NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network maintains the World Meteorological Organization international calibration scales for CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, and SF6 in air. The measurements of the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network serve as a comparison with measurements made by many other international laboratories, and with regional studies. They are widely used in studies inferring space-time patterns of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases that are optimally consistent with the atmospheric observations. They serve as an early warning for climate \"surprises\". The measurements are also helpful for the ongoing evaluation of remote sensing technologies.  The CCGG cooperative air sampling network effort began in 1967 at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Today, the network is an international effort which includes regular discrete samples from the NOAA ESRL/GMD baseline observatories, cooperative fixed sites, and commercial ships. Air samples are collected approximately weekly from a globally distributed network of sites. Samples are analyzed for Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrogen Gas (H2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6); and by INSTAAR for the stable isotopes of CO2 and CH4 and for many volatile organic compounds (voc) such as ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4) and propane (C3H8). Measurement data are used to identify long-term trends, seasonal variability, and spatial distribution of carbon cycle gases.

Existing television, radio and cell phone towers are utilized as sampling platforms for continuous in-situ sampling of CO2 and other atmospheric trace gases, including carbon monoxide (CO) in the continental boundary layer. The measured data are baseline levels, trends, and causes of variability of atmospheric gases that have the potential to affect global climate. The tall tower sites are part of the North American Carbon Program and are a primary data source for ESRL's Carbon Tracker CO2 data assimilation system. The historic data set is from 8 tall towers.

The catalogue MSAQSO2L4 file contains the site coordinates, source type, country, source name, annual SO2 emissions and uncertainties, and the number of EOS Aura/OMI satellite SO2 measurements used for emissions estimates near each source.   The 2018 data have been recently added to the catalogue and the minor version in the file name is now upgraded to v01-04.  There are no systematic differences between the old  and new minor versions. The fitting areas are a slightly  different for some sites, but the resulting differences in the data are within the known uncertainties ranges. A major update to the catalogue is aniticipated in the summer of 2019.  The emissions  estimates are based on the fitting of the operational Aura/OMI planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO2 data produced with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm (10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022) and a site-specific AMF adjustment  for each site (Fioletov et al., 2016). The emission estimate method for linking OMI level 2 SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) to emissions is based on a fit of OMI VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution (as seen by OMI) near emissions point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially along wind direction and are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a 2D Gaussian function. The average  SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime."

It contains surface emissivity over the land at 90 meters spatial resolution. Estimates of surface emissivity were thus far only derived using surrogates such as land-cover type or vegetation index.   The Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is used to derive both E (emissivity) and T (surface temperature). The main goals of the TES algorithm include: recovering accurate and precise emissivities for mineral substrates, and estimating accurate and precise surface temperatures especially over vegetation, water and snow.The TES algorithm is executed in the ASTER processing chain following generation of ASTER Level-2 Surface Radiance (TIR). The land-leaving radiance and down-welling irradiance vectors for each pixel are taken in account. Emissivity is estimated using the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM), and is iteratively compensated for reflected sunlight. The emissivity spectrum is normalized using the average emissivity of each pixel. The minimum-maximum difference (MMD) of the normalized spectrum is calculated and estimates of the minimum emissivity derived through regression analysis. These estimates are used to scale the normalized emissivity and compensate for reflected skylight with the derived refinement of emissivity.

It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

The air samples are returned to ESRL for analysis where measurements of about 55 trace gases are done. NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network maintains the World Meteorological Organization international calibration scales for CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, and SF6 in air. The measurements of the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network serve as a comparison with measurements made by many other international laboratories, and with regional studies.

Observatory Measurements: NOAA/ESRL/GMD operates four staffed atmospheric baseline observatories from which numerous measurements of greenhouse gases are conducted. These baseline observatories, also known as global background sites, are located in Barrow, Alaska; Mauna Loa, Hawaii; American Samoa; and South Pole, Antarctica. The measured data are baseline levels, trends, and causes of variability of atmospheric gases that have the potential to affect global climate. These observatories were established in order to provide a sampling of the most remote air on the planet so that the true \"background atmosphere\" could be monitored. GMD first began continuous in-situ measurements of CO2 at these observatories in 1973, and added CH4 and CO measurements in the 1980's. The ongoing data set is contingent upon the baseline observatories that are still in use going forward.   A subset of Observatory Measurements for only carbon dioxide (CO2) taken from Observatories is archived separately with digital object identifiers (DOIs) for each of the four observation stations listed above. The observations run from 1973 through the end of 2016. The main portion of this agreement is for the enhanced \"version\" of the more encompassing dataset for all of the different types of observation platforms and gases.

Aircraft Program Measurements: Since its inception in 1992, the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network's aircraft program has been dedicated to collecting air samples in vertical profiles over North America. The program's mission is to capture seasonal and inter-annual changes in trace gas mixing ratios throughout the boundary layer and free troposphere. Data collected by the aircraft program provide a view of how the large-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of the measured trace gases change throughout a given year over the continent. The measured data are baseline levels, trends, and causes of variability of atmospheric gases that have the potential to affect global climate.   The historical data set contains measurements from 31 aircraft program missions. The ongoing data set is contingent upon the aircraft program missions that are still in use going forward. At present, most aircraft program flights collect 12 flask samples at different altitudes via a portable, automated sampling system. At a predetermined altitude, the sampling system is simply activated by a toggle switch that is easily accessible to the pilot. Time, location and auxiliary variables such as temperature and relative humidity are logged with each sample and downloaded into the NOAA/ESRL database when the samples are returned to the laboratory. Sampling frequency and height distribution varies at each site, but samples are collected from 500 m above ground to 8000 m above sea level at the majority of aircraft sites. While sampling flights have been conducted at some sites as often as two to three times per week, sample flights at most sites are only carried out once every two to three weeks.

The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.              The boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2019, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census."

DEFINITIONS    Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.    Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.    Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.    NOTES    Data on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).    Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.    Hierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).    The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that    1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,    where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).    County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).    SOURCES    National Center for Health Statistics.

Recently, the Union Camp Corporation donated this large parcel of swamp wilderness to the Nature Conservancy, which will turn it over to the U.S. Department of the Interior. There are approximately 300,000 acres remaining of this last great wilderness area along the Coastal Plain of the Middle Atlantic states. The list of plants in this report is not complete, but it certainly contains most of the species of trees, shrubs, and vines of the Swamp, including some mention of various herbaceous plants. The plant community at this latitude that presents the sharpest contrast with the more northerly woods is the pocosin, bay, or broad-leaved evergreen shrub bog. This combination of broad-leaved evergreens, bays, and pond pines does not occur north of the Dismal Swamp as a major plant community. Such areas in the Dismal Swamp are known as \"lights.\" In the north Jericho Ditch section of the Swamp, in the spring of 1968, I came across two of the rarest plants in southeastern Virginia: the wild or silky camellia and the dwarf trillium. The Great Dismal Swamp area is also the northern outpost for numerous ocher southern plants and for a number of animals, including the cottonmouth moccasin, canebrake rattler, chameleon or green anole, little grass frog ( tiniest North American frog ), squirrel treefrog, southern toad, yellow-bellied turtle, cotton mouse, marsh rabbit, Wayne's black-throated green warbler, and Florida grackle. Nowhere else at this latitude in eastern North America is there such an accumulation of diverse southern forms, and more of them occur in the Swamp than in the surrounding area. Since the Dismal Swamp is mostly solid forest, it is essentially a songbird    swamp. There are about 84 species of breeding birds in the Swamp. Present are the Swainson's Warbler. The Wayne's and yellow-throated warblers and the yellow-throated vireo are the so-called treetop birds of the swamp forest, usually ranging between 40 and 80 feet up. Appendices contain the following information: Trees, Shrubs, and Vines of the Dismal Swamp; Arrival Dates of Some Spring Migrants; Composition and Relative Abundance of Breeding Birds; and A Preliminary List of Dismal Swamp Mammals."

Primary attention was directed to the major use areas near Crescent City, Colusa, and Modesto, but surveys were also conducted in the Los Banos and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta areas. A combined fall estimate of 1970 in the Colusa and Crescent City areas and a spring estimate of 1940 in the Crescent City area were the highest ever recorded. A total of 200 marked individuals were observed 3916 times. Among these were 1 captive-reared bird from the release on Agattu Island in the western Aleutians in 1979, 28 captive-reared birds (including 19 young) from the release in 1980, 2 wild young transplanted from Buldir Island to Agattu in 1979, and 44 wild birds (including 36 young) transplanted in 1980. The combined sighting-recovery rate of birds used in the 1980 program was 73 percent for transplanted birds but only 15 percent for released birds. A total mortality of 35 known and 8 possible Aleutians, including 13 shot illegally, is somewhat higher than in previous years. The present closure zones were effective in protecting the Aleutian Canada goose population. Eighty-three birds were banded in the spring near Crescent City."

Four companies own 5 mining operations in the vicinity of Green River, Wyoming, and produce 90 percent of the soda ash in the United States, which accounts for more than 30 percent of the world supply. Trona refining produces \u201ctailings\u201d water that is either discharged into open evaporation ponds or recycled back into the mining operation and used to facilitate trona ore extraction. As water evaporates from the ponds, chemical residues become concentrated. At cooler temperatures (generally <40\u00b0F) sodium decahydrate precipitates out of the water and crystallizes on solid objects in the ponds or on the water surface. Migratory birds landing on the evaporation ponds and being exposed to the water are affected by the sodium decahydrate and other chemical precipitates. Water samples collected from multiple evaporation ponds had similar physical and chemical composition with the exception of phytoplankton species present. Representative total dissolved solids (TDS) ranged from approximately 40,000 ppm (parts per million) to greater than 300,000 ppm depending on the pond and time of year. Eared grebe mean serum sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and uric acid were elevated immediately after capture compared to serum biochemical parameters from eared grebes collected from a reference site in British Columbia, Canada. Histopathologic evidence consistent with drowning was observed in all grebes, but it is not known whether this was a direct mortality factor or a late terminal event."

Communities in Hawaii often rely on these fisheries for economic, social, and cultural services. However, the stress from overfishing can cause ecosystem degradation and long-term economic loss. This layer represents the average annual commercial catch of reef fish by line fishing over the years 2003-2013 as reported in commercial catch data collected by the State of Hawaii Department of Aquatic Resources (DAR) Commercial Marine Landings Database (CML). \"Line fishing\" is a fairly broad category that can include casting, trolling, hand line, short line, and others. These gears were grouped together for consistency with non-commercial catch estimates from McCoy (2015). Commercial catch is reported to DAR in large irregular reporting blocks by gear and by species.  This layer's spatial footprint aligns with the inshore commercial reporting blocks from the shapefile served on the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program website (Fishchart2008.shp) (http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/). Data are filtered by DAR before release such that reporting blocks with less than three fishers reporting are excluded in order to protect fisher identities. It is not possible to explicitly distinguish between boat-based and shore-based fishing based on the gear types reported in CML data. The Ocean Tipping Points (OTP) project filtered the data for line fishing and reef fish species only and calculated average annual catch in kilograms by reporting block to match with data from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP). In marine protected areas (MPAs) where boat-based fishing is not allowed, catch was set to zero; and inside de facto MPAs with restricted access, catch was reduced according to expert input and local knowledge. Average annual commercial catch data were converted from polygon to raster and then divided by the number of 100-m raster cells within each reporting block so that units are comparable to non-commercial fishing layers (kg/ha). The result assumes commercial catch is evenly distributed spatially across each reporting block.  See also:    McCoy, K. 2015. Estimating nearshore fisheries catch for the main Hawaiian Islands.

These island-scale estimates were spatially distributed offshore using distance to boat harbors and launch ramps while accounting for marine protected areas (MPAs) and de facto MPAs (e.g., military danger zones) where access is restricted. A Gaussian decay function assumed the majority of the catch occurs within 10-20 km of each harbor. Additionally, the Ocean Tipping Points (OTP) project weighted boat harbors by the human population present within 30 km. This layer's spatial footprint aligns with the inshore commercial reporting blocks for commercial fish catch reporting to the State of Hawaii Department of Aquatic Resources (DAR). This layer is the sum of the three final gear-specific non-commercial boat-based OTP rasters (line, net, and spear).  Point data for boat harbors and launch ramps were combined from two datasets available from the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program website (Harbors.shp and BoatingFacilities.shp) (http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/). Data were checked for quality to ensure only operational boat harbors and launch ramps were included and geographic positions were accurate. Anchorages, fishing piers, historic, and disused ramps/harbors were removed prior to analysis. Boat facility weighting factors were calculated based on total human population within 30 km of each boat harbor or ramp. Human population was mapped based on 2010 census data and LANDFIRE land use/land cover data using the USGS Dasymetric Mapping Tool to gain a more accurate representation of population distribution. A 30-km buffer was then created around each boating facility and a Zonal Statistics tool was used to sum the human population within each buffer. These population values were then used to assign weights to each boating facility in order to allocate a proportion of total island catch estimates to each boat harbor or ramp. These weights sum to 1 for each island.  In order to allocate catch proportionally to each boat harbor/ramp, estimated annual catch at the island scale and the human population-based weighting factor were joined to the attribute table of each boating facility's cost allocation footprint and used in a Gaussian decay function with each distance surface. This decay function assumes the majority of catch occurs within 10-20 km of a harbor or ramp and declines more rapidly with increasing distance.

Attributes for slope and road accessibility were then combined into a single accessibility criterion. A weighting scheme was created that assumes easily accessible shorelines with flat slopes and paved public road access have the highest catch and that catch decreases incrementally with level of accessibility. Any combination that includes no accessibility due to steep slopes received a zero weight and therefore zero fishing. Weights sum to 1 for each island. These weights were then multiplied by the MRIP island-scale estimates of annual catch at each coastal point, for three shore-based gear types: line, net, and spear. For line fishing, catch was extended offshore 200 m. For net fishing, catch was extended offshore to the 20-ft depth contour with a maximum distance from shore of 1 km. For spear fishing, a logistic decay function was used so catch decreases with depth to 40 m or a maximum distance of 2 km from shore. Catch in full no-take MPAs were set to zero and other areas with restricted access were reduced according to expert input and local knowledge.  Final pixels values are in units of kg/ha such that the sum of all pixels for each island is equal to the estimates of average annual catch from McCoy et al. (in prep). Units, pixel size, and grid alignment are consistent with all other OTP fishing layers so that they can be compared directly or added together for various uses.  See also:  McCoy, K. 2015.

                "text": "Non-commercial Boat-based Line Fishing Estimated Average Annual Catch of Reef Fish, 2004-2013 - Hawaii Nearshore fisheries in the Main Hawaiian Islands encompass a diverse group of fishers using a wide array of gears and targeting many different species. Communities in Hawaii often rely on these fisheries for economic, social, and cultural services. However, the stress from overfishing can cause ecosystem degradation and long-term economic loss. This layer represents the average annual catch of reef fish by non-commercial boat-based line fishing methods. Average annual catch at the island scale from 2004-2013 was estimated from Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) combined fisher intercept and phone survey data (McCoy, 2015; McCoy et al., in prep). These island-scale estimates were spatially distributed offshore using distance to boat harbors and launch ramps while accounting for marine protected areas (MPAs) and de facto MPAs (e.g., military danger zones) where access is restricted. A Gaussian decay function assumed the majority of the catch occurs within 10-20 km of each harbor. Additionally, the Ocean Tipping Points (OTP) project weighted boat harbors by the human population present within 30 km. This layer's spatial footprint aligns with the inshore commercial reporting blocks for commercial fish catch reporting to the State of Hawaii Department of Aquatic Resources (DAR).  Point data for boat harbors and launch ramps were combined from two datasets available from the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program website (Harbors.shp and BoatingFacilities.shp) (http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/). Data were checked for quality to ensure only operational boat harbors and launch ramps were included and geographic positions were accurate. Anchorages, fishing piers, historic, and disused ramps/harbors were removed prior to analysis. Boat facility weighting factors were calculated based on total human population within 30 km of each boat harbor or ramp. Human population was mapped based on 2010 census data and LANDFIRE land use/land cover data using the USGS Dasymetric Mapping Tool to gain a more accurate representation of population distribution. A 30-km buffer was then created around each boating facility and a Zonal Statistics tool was used to sum the human population within each buffer. These population values were then used to assign weights to each boating facility in order to allocate a proportion of total island catch estimates to each boat harbor or ramp. These weights sum to 1 for each island.  In order to allocate catch proportionally to each boat harbor/ramp, estimated annual catch at the island scale and the human population-based weighting factor were joined to the attribute table of each boating facility's cost allocation footprint and used in a Gaussian decay function with each distance surface. This decay function assumes the majority of catch occurs within 10-20 km of a harbor or ramp and declines more rapidly with increasing distance. Catch in full no-take MPAs were set to zero and other areas with restricted access were reduced according to expert input and local knowledge. Pixel values within each boating facility's footprint were then rescaled such that the sum in each footprint was equal to the respective boat facility's weighting factor times the MRIP catch estimate for that island in units of kg per pixel. Finally, all raster layers for each boat harbor/ramp were summed together.  Final pixels values are in units of kg/ha such that the sum of all pixels for each island is equal to the estimates of average annual catch from McCoy et al. (in prep). Units, pixel size, and grid alignment are consistent with all other OTP fishing layers so that they can be compared directly or added together for various uses.  See also:  McCoy, K. 2015.

Effort was clearly dominated by the professional guiding operators (71%) while the recreational private sector made up the balance (29%). Fishermen caught eight species of fishes with Arctic char and coho salmon comprising the largest component of the catches. Most anglers fishing the Togiak apparently subscribe to a self-imposed catch and release philosophy. This was evidenced by the small fraction (9.7%) of the total catch being ki11ed and kept. Coho salmon were the most likely fish to be kept by anglers."

                "text": "1984 walrus harvest, health, and welfare study at Gambell, Alaska: Progress report The recorded harvest between 25 April and 8 June in Gambell was 1499 walruses. There were 373 adult males, 528 adult females, 405 calves, and 193 of unknown sex. Adult refers to animals older than calves yet not necessarily sexually mature. This was the largest harvest recorded in Gambell in the last 5 years and perhaps in recent history. Several factors influenced the high harvest. The last two of three strikes on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) was lost 26 April and walrus hunting commenced 29 April. Although this was 2 weeks earlier than the walrus hunt in 1983 (Sease 1983), it was a week or more later than the bunts in 1982 (Malloy 1982) and 1981 (Lourie 1981). However, not catching a whale certainly motivated the hunters to bring in more walrus meat. There were 26 days during the 1984 monitoring period when walrus were captured as opposed to 20 days in 1983 and 19 days in 1982. Ice and wind conditions were such that hunters had greater access to walrus than the previous three years. During the 1982 and 1983 monitoring periods, there were only two days each year on which more than 100 walrus were retrieved. During the 1984 monitoring session, the catch exceeded 100 walrus on six days (Table 2). The hunters were reporting large herds and good ice conditions. Small amounts of ice persisted until 1 June which was the last day 15 or more walrus were retrieved. The shore ice on the north beach held fast until 2 June. It seemed that thick ice capable of supporting walrus persisted a week longer in 1984 than the previous 3 seasons. Proportionately more females and calves were caught during the 1984 monitoring session than during 1981 (chi-square 16.34, 2 df) or during 1983 (chi-square 23.48, 2 df, Table 3). More male walrus were taken than expected during the 1984 season when compared to 1982 (chi-square 8.23, 2 df). The distribution of hunting days relative to the walrus migration probably explains the differences in sex composition between years. There were fewer hunting days at the end of May and the beginning of June during 1982 than 1983 or 1984 (Malloy 1982, Sease 1983). This year there were more hunting days in April and early May than during 1983. Female and calf walrus are the first to migrate and tend to stay with thicker ice (Fay 1982). Male walrus migrate later and were taken in greater numbers by Gambell hunters during the end of May and beginning of June. Female and calf walrus are preferred for their meat in Gambell and are taken in large numbers early in the hunting season."

DEFINITIONS    Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.    Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.    Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.    NOTES    Data on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).    Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.    Hierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).    The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that    1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,    where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).    County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).    SOURCES    National Center for Health Statistics.

The majority of observations of female moose,(Alces alces) with recently-born calves have been in open, bog-meadow, black spruce, (Picea mariana), habitats on the Kenai National Moose Range, but many moose probably calve in other areas where they are more difficult to observe. Frequent aerial surveys over the Moose-Chickaloon River Area during the calving period from 1957 to 1970 revealed maximum numbers of observed cows in the calving area in 1964, or 17 years after a major wildfire burned through the area. Numbers of observed cows declined after several years of antlerless seasons and several severe winters but increased again after antlerless seasons were suspended and winters moderated. Numbers of observed calves paralleled numbers of observed cows. Maximum twinning rates declined from a high of 46 percent in 1962 to 7 percent in 1966 but increased to 48 percent in 1969. Twinning rates appeared related to forage conditions, mild winters and moose density. General observations and observed numbers of calves suggest two birth peaks may have occurred in the 1960's, one in early June and another in early July. Population estimates suggest generally less than 20 percent of the refuge's moose population calve in the Moose-Chickaloon River Area."

Liberibacter asiaticus'-infected citrus plants Background    Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), which is linked to the bacterial Candidatus pathogen 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' (Las), is the most devastating disease of citrus plants, and longer-term control measures via breeding or genetic engineering have been unwieldy because all cultivated citrus species are susceptible to the disease. However, the degree of susceptibility varies among citrus species, which has prompted efforts to identify potential Las resistance/tolerance-related genes in citrus plants for application in breeding or genetic engineering programs. Plant exposure to one form of stress has been shown to serendipitously induce innate resistance to other forms of stress and a recent study showed that continuous heat treatment (40 to 42 \u00b0C) reduced Las titer and HLB-associated symptoms in citrus seedlings. The goal of the present study was to apply comparative proteomics analysis via 2-DE and mass spectrometry to elucidate the molecular processes associated with heat-induced mitigation of HLB in citrus plants. Healthy or Las-infected citrus grapefruit plants were exposed to room temperature or to continuous heat treatment of 40 \u00b0C for 6 days.    Results    An exhaustive total protein extraction process facilitated the identification of 107 differentially-expressed proteins in response to Las and/or heat treatment, which included a strong up-regulation of chaperones including small (23.6, 18.5 and 17.9 kDa) heat shock proteins, a HSP70-like protein and a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO)-binding 60 kDa chaperonin, particularly in response to heat treatment. Other proteins that were generally down-regulated due to Las infection but up-regulated in response to heat treatment include RuBisCO activase, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, glucosidase II beta subunit-like protein, a putative lipoxygenase protein, a ferritin-like protein, and a glutathione S-transferase.    Conclusions    The differentially-expressed proteins identified in this study highlights a premier characterization of the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the reversal of Las-induced pathogenicity processes in citrus plants and are hence proposed targets for application towards the development of cisgenic Las-resistant/tolerant citrus plants."

Historic fish tissue data collected by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from eastern North Carolina National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) documented mercury concentrations at or above levels of concern for public consumption in a few fish species (e.g., largemouth bass). Other game species have not been frequently sampled (e.g., crappie, flier, and bluegill). Based on this concern, updated information on the mercury concentration in important recreational fish species was collected to inform refuge fisheries management. Between 2004 and 2006, 305 fillet and 18 whole body fish samples were collected from Alligator River, Mattamuskeet, Pocosin Lakes, and Pee Dee NWRs. Mercury concentrations in fish fillets indicate that catfish (geometric mean = 0.16 ppm-ww; range 0.01 to 0.99 ppm-ww) and sunfish (geometric mean = 0.18 ppm-ww; range 0.03-0.46 ppm-ww) species are generally below the state action level for issuing public health consumption advisories. Half of the perch (geometric mean = 0.33 ppm-ww; range 0.13-0.67 ppm-ww) and 84 percent of largemouth bass (geometric mean = 0.57 ppm-ww; range 0.03-1.6 ppm-ww) fillets exceeded human consumptive levels of concern. In addition to the State fish consumption advisory, our data would support species-specific fish size thresholds for refuge waters to minimize health risks of mercury exposure for the general public for bluegill (eat fish smaller than 36 cm total length) and largemouth bass (eat fish smaller than 21 cm total length). Because bluegill rarely exceed 36 cm in length, most individuals caught on refuges are safe to eat. This is consistent with the State\u2019s fish consumption advice. The current legal size limit for largemouth bass (of 35.6 cm) precludes consumption of small individuals with lower mercury levels in refuge waters; only catch and release fishing or limited consumption (consistent with the State\u2019s advisory: http://www.epi.state.nc.us/epi/fish/safefish.html) for this species is advised. The toxicological significance of fish tissue mercury residues to piscivorous birds was also evaluated. Mercury concentrations measured in whole fish frequently exceeded levels reported to adversely affect sensitive avian species. Estimates of whole fish mercury concentrations (based on fillet mercury residues) also frequently (84 percent) exceeded avian dietary toxicity thresholds. A comprehensive wildlife risk assessment could be performed with dietary input modeling and site specific exposure assessment."

The calibrated model, which uses MODFLOW-NWT version 1.1.2, simulates hydrologic changes in pool stages, groundwater levels, spring flows, and streamflows caused by the diversion of streamflow from the Withlacoochee River to the Tsala Apopka Lake basin through water-control structures. A surface-water/groundwater flow model was developed using hydraulic parameters for lakes, streams, the unsaturated zone, and the underlying surficial and Upper Floridan aquifers estimated with an inverse modeling calibration technique. After calibration, the model was used to assess the relation between inflows and outflows in the Tsala Apopka Lake basin and changes in pool stages. Simulation results using the calibrated surface-water/groundwater flow model showed that the largest leakage rates from the pools to the Upper Floridan aquifer occurred at the deep lake cells and that these leakage rates were higher than any recharge rates to the Upper Floridan aquifer in the model area. There was downward leakage to the Upper Floridan aquifer in most of the Floral City, Inverness, and Hernando pools. The calibrated surface-water and groundwater flow model was used to simulate hydrologic scenarios that included: small changes in rainfall rates, projected increases in groundwater pumping rates for 2025 and 2035, no flow for the entire period through the eight water-control structures in the Tsala Apopka Lake basin, and the removal of the Inglis Dam and the Inglis Bypass Spillway on Lake Rousseau.

This 700 acre lake receives water from the Trinity River. The river drains the moderately industrialized Dallas - Fort Worth, Texas metroplex, and flows southward for 250 miles (402 km) through several small urban areas and ranch land. Prior contaminant investigations of sites upstream of the refuge indicated several organochlorine compounds and heavy metals which may pose a hazard to fish eating birds and human consumption of aquatic resources from Champion Lake (Irwin 1988, Ulery and Brown 1994, and Moring 1997). On request of the Refuge Manager, in June, 2002, personnel from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) Ecological Services Field Office in Clear Lake, TX initiated an investigation to determine levels of contaminants in sediments and fish inhabiting Champion Lake on the Refuge and to assess risks to people that eat fish from Champion Lake. To accomplish this, tissue samples, consisting of fillet and whole body samples from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) and white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), edible portions of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), and sediment samples were collected from Champion Lake and analyzed for 29 organochlorine compounds and 19 heavy metals. Additionally, sediment samples were also analyzed for 44 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PCB, mercury, and dieldrin fish tissue concentrations showed exceedences of screening values. Exceedences of the recreational fisher PCB screening value (0.02 ppm) were found in four out of five of the bass fillet samples, three out of five of the catfish fillet samples, and two out of five of the crappie fillet samples. All the remaining samples exceed the subsistence fisher PCB screening value (0.00245 ppm). Exceedences of the recreational fisher mercury screening value (0.4 ppm) were found in one of the five crab samples and one of the five catfish fillet samples. All remaining samples exceed the subsistence fisher mercury screening value (0.049 ppm). The process detailed in USEPA\u2019s Guidance for Assessing Chemical Contamination Data for Use in Fish Advisories was followed in determining fish consumption recommendations. Results indicate that fish and crab from Champion Lake contain elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. The Service recommends taking a conservative approach based on these preliminary findings and posting a fish consumption guideline for blue crab, bass, catfish and crappie. Utilizing EPA\u2019s default assumptions it is recommended that individuals should restrict their consumption of crab to one eight ounce meal per month, largemouth bass to three eight ounce meals per month, and catfish and crappie to two eight ounce meals per mouth. These data are based on preliminary sampling. To more thoroughly assess risk, a creel survey should be conducted to examine species consumed and frequency of consumption. Further studies should be conducted involving the collection of fish, crawfish, avian eggs, and water samples to determine the extent and availability of mercury and PCBs to fish and other wildlife resources at the Refuge."

Spotted seatrout were from 260 to 445 mm (10.2-17.5 in) in length. Twenty percent of the seatrout had mercury levels in fillets (range = 0.17 to 0.92 mg/kg wet weight; ppm) that exceeded the Florida limited-consumption concentration of 0.5 ppm wet weight. Hardhead catfish were from 268- 412 mm in length and mercury concentrations in fillets ranged from 0.10 to 1.28 ppm. Sixteen percent of hardhead catfish had mercury concentrations exceeding 0.5 ppm. Gafftopsail catfish were from 284 to 484 mm (11.2 to 19.1 in) in length. Mercury levels ranged from 0.45 to 0.84 ppm with one of two samples exceeding the limited-consumption concentration. However, no individuals of the fish species contained concentrations which exceeded the Florida no-consumption concentration of 1.5 ppm wet weight. Although all locations sampled appears to provide environments conducive for accumulation of mercury in fish; concentrations in hardhead catfish caught at the mouth of the river were much greater (p<0.001) than those in the same species collected at other locations. As all fish collected had mercury concentrations in excess of 0.1 ppm, several fish and wildlife trust species may be at risk when utilizing the habitat areas sampled.

One brown bullhead (lctalurus nebulosus) had a mercury concentration below any level of concern. Evaluation of weight, length and age of largemouth bass did not provide mechanisms by which recreational fishermen could selectively retain individual fish that are low in mercury. All locations that were sampled appear to provide environments conducive for accumulation of mercury in largemouth bass and other fish species.

The availability of the 'Ca. L. asiaticus' genome sequence has facilitated development of molecular markers from this bacterium. The objectives of this study were to develop microsatellite markers and conduct genetic analyses of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' from a worldwide collection. Two hundred eighty seven isolates from USA (Florida), Brazil, China, India, Cambodia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, and Japan were analyzed.    A panel of seven polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed for 'Ca. L. asiaticus'. Microsatellite analyses across the samples showed that the genetic diversity of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' is higher in Asia than Americas. UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses identified three major genetic groups worldwide. Isolates from India were genetically distinct. East-southeast Asian and Brazilian isolates were generally included in the same group; a few members of this group were found in Florida, but the majority of the isolates from Florida were clustered separately. eBURST analysis predicted three founder haplotypes, which may have given rise to three groups worldwide.    Results identified three major genetic groups of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' worldwide. Isolates from Brazil showed similar genetic makeup with east-southeast Asian dominant group, suggesting the possibility of a common origin. However, most of the isolates recovered from Florida were clustered in a separate group. While the sources of the dominant 'Ca. L. asiaticus' in Florida were not clearly understood, the less-pervasive groups may have been introduced directly from Asia or via Brazil. Notably, the recent outbreak of HLB in Florida probably occurred through multiple introductions. Microsatellite markers developed in this study provide adequate discriminatory power for the identification and differentiation of closely-related isolates, as well as for genetic studies of 'Ca. L. asiaticus'.    The supporting data provides sample and haplotype information for all isolates used in this study: Huanglongbing_Las-SSR-Genotype; Huanglongbing_GT-Populationwise; and Huanglongbing_Cln-Corrected-Dat."

The fish were collected for mercury analysis of muscle tissue. Three percent of the largemouth bass had mercury levels (range=0.20 to 1.17 ppm) which exceeded the Florida limited-consumption concentration of 0.5 parts per million (ppm), wet weight. No fish exceeded Florida's no-consumption concentration of 1.5 ppm. Evaluation of weight, length and site location of largemouth bass did not provide mechanisms by which recreational fishermen could selectively avoid individual fish that are high in mercury. All locations that were sampled appear to provide environments conducive for accumulation of mercury in largemouth bass; however, there were no significant differences in mercury concentrations between stations. Because all fish collected contained concentrations of mercury greater than 0.1 ppm, some Fish and Wildlife Service trust species may be exposed to risk when utilizing the habitat areas that were sampled.

It was designed to answer the following questions:  Evaluation question 1: How do energy-efficient products impact ambient air pollution levels, and health and income of residents in Ulaanbaatar? Specifically:    a) How does the use of MCA stoves affect fuel usage and expenditures?    b) Does the use of MCA stoves affect available household income?    c) What is the impact of MCA stoves on emissions of CO and PM2.5?     d) What is the impact of MCA stoves on indoor concentrations of CO and PM2.5?     e) What would be the estimated change in health for Ulaanbaatar residents?    f) How do MCA stoves affect household expenditures related to respiratory health problems?  Evaluation question 2: How do different MCA stove models and different patterns of usage affect the level of impact on ambient air pollution, and the health and income of households with MCA stoves? Specifically:    a) Do different MCA stove model types impact fuel expenditures, income, and PM2.5 emissions, under typical usage behavior?    b) Do deviations from expected MCA stove usage patterns impact air pollution, health, and income of households with MCA stoves?    c) Did the MCA stove program result in differential impacts on men and women?    d) Does possession of additional energy efficiency products such as vestibules or additional ger insulation modify the impact of MCA stoves on ambient air pollution, health, and income?  Since this program was a market-based intervention, households chose whether to purchase an MCA stove. Because a randomized intervention assignment was not possible and the evaluation was implemented after the project had started, a quasi-experimental propensity score matching (PSM) design was used to adjust for differences between those who did and did not choose to purchase an MCA stove. Matching on propensity scores enabled construction of treatment and comparison groups that were balanced along the observed characteristics, thereby providing a counterfactual for the intervention.  Key findings include:   Participants in the EEP stove subsidy program had 65% lower emissions of PM2.5 and 16% lower CO emissions, both statistically significant, compared to traditional stoves under typical usage conditions.    The EEP stove subsidy program reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations over UB attributable to heating stoves by an estimated 30%, with largest reductions in highly polluted areas that were more heavily targeted by the program.    Factors known to affect coal consumption differed systematically between Ulzii, Khas, and Dul stove users.   The EEP stove subsidy program achieved high demand for energy-efficient stoves and satisfaction among stove users; however, some stove limitations remained barriers to satisfaction.   The EEP stove subsidy program did not achieve significant reductions in daily coal consumption under typical usage conditions.    Very low compliance with MCA stove operation instructions may have contributed to lack of reduced coal consumption.    Significant reductions in coal use were observed when households used MCA stoves according to instructions.    Households using MCA stoves enjoyed significantly higher indoor temperatures, suggesting that users may be sacrificing fuel economy for comfort.    There is no evidence that the EEP stove subsidy program achieved reductions in overall coal expenditures.    MCA stove owners in gers with better insulation used less coal than traditional stove owners.    Observed emissions reductions may have contributed to substantially fewer cases of air pollution-related respiratory illness and related costs."

                "text": "Analysis of Virtual Sensors for Predicting Aircraft Fuel Consumption Previous research described the use of machine learning algorithms to predict aircraft fuel consumption. This technique, known as Virtual Sensors, models fuel consumption as a function of aircraft Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data. FOQA data consist of a large number of measurements that are already recorded by many commercial airlines. The predictive model is used for anomaly detection in the fuel consumption history by noting when measured fuel consumption exceeds an expected value. This exceedance may indicate overconsumption of fuel, the source of which may be identified and corrected by the aircraft operator. This would reduce both fuel emissions and operational costs. This paper gives a brief overview of the modeling approach and describes efforts to validate and analyze the initial results of this project. We examine the typical error in modeling, and compare modeling accuracy against both complex and  simplistic regression approaches. We also estimate a ranking of the importance of each FOQA variable used as input, and demonstrate that FOQA variables can reliably be used to identify different modes of fuel consumption, which may be useful in future work. Analysis indicates that fuel consumption is accurately predicted while remaining theoretically sensitive to sub-nominal pilot inputs and maintenance-related issues."

                "text": "Honduras - Farmer Training and Development The evaluation design for this activity changed over the course of the evaluation due to problems faced during implementation. In its original conception, the independent evaluator, NORC, and MCA-Honduras planned to use a randomized experimental design involving randomized assignment of communities (aldeas) to treatment. Following a series of implementation problems, the final approach used was an econometric model that relied on a model-based approach to impact evaluation. As raised in the evaluator report, one key assumption is that the causal models are correct. This is based on the assumption that all important unobserved variables affecting selection, such as proven ex-ante ability to grow horticultural crops, are time invariant (i.e., are constant between the two survey rounds).   Assumptions of the econometric model are:    1. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA, no macro effects assumption, partial equilibrium assumption) is made. This means that the effect (potential outcomes) on one individual are not affected by potential changes in the treatment exposure of other individuals. This implies, for example, that the program is not so large that the outcomes are correlated (e.g., that farmers would produce such a large amount of horticultural crops that the market would collapse).     2. The causal models are correct. The key assumption here is that all important unobserved variables affecting selection are time invariant (i.e., are constant between the two survey rounds).     3. The program intervention represents a \u201cforced change\u201d in (experimental control of) the agricultural system in Honduras.    4. The half of the country treated before this evaluation began is similar to the half yet to be treated, with respect to relationships among the important causal variables represented in the causal model underlying the statistical analysis.   The exposure period was 12-36 months.   Results from the final evaluation report include: the Model-based approach estimated net income change from horticultural crops is on average USD 600 higher for program participants than for nonparticipants. Input expenditures on these crops increased far more than they did for basic crops, implying a higher level of activity in cultivation of high value crops among program farmers. The results suggest a corresponding decline among program farmers in income from basic crops, as might be expected with changing crop mix; however, this decline is not statistically significant.    However, the program also did not appear to have had a positive effect on the proportion of farmers growing horticultural crops. This could well be because the implementer primarily chose as program participants farmers who showed a proven ability to grow horticultural crops. It is likely that increments in income from horticultural crops came from increased production among farmers already growing horticultural crops and not from farmers who switched over for the first time.  Even though there was an increase in income from horticultural crops, the evaluator did not find a corresponding statistically significant increase in net household income or household expenditures/consumption, as might have been expected."

                "text": "Indonesia - Green Prosperity: Community-Based Off-Grid Renewable Energy Grant Portfolio Taken as a whole, this evaluation aims, to the extent possible, to validate the program logic underlying the portfolio of community-based off-grid renewable energy grants in the Green Prosperity Grant Facility, doing so through a focused investigation of two specific grants: W3A Akuo Energy Solar/Micro-Hydro, Berau and W3A Anekatek Solar, East Sumba. It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

The original steady-state model documented in the USGS report (https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5003/) and data release (https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7D21VS2) was calibrated to a low groundwater level/dry weather condition of October 2002 and a high groundwater level/wet weather condition of March 2011. For this study the 2002 and 2011 simulations were updated with elevation data collected from a 2017 survey of primary surface-water features that affect groundwater levels to create dry- or wet-weather \u00e2\u0080\u009cbase\u00e2\u0080\u009d simulations (figs. 1 and 2). Eight scenario models were created by modifying the updated 2002 and 2011 base simulations. The scenarios examined the effects of potential modifications to the hydrologic system: (scenario 1a) diverting water from US-12 weir (site CS-1) to County Line Road ditch through underground pipes [figs. 3-6], (scenario 1b) diverting water from US-12 ditch to Spencer ditch, then trenching Spencer ditch to the County Line Road ditch to drain to the Little Calumet River [figs. 7 and 8], (scenario 2) Extending and altering US-12 ditch to flow east toward County Line Road ditch and drain to the Little Calumet River [figs. 9 and 10], and (scenario 3) installing culverts under US-12 and adjacent railroad lines to connect US-12 ditch with West Long Lake [figs. 11-14]. This data release contains all files and associated information needed to run these additional simulations. Changes in water-table position for each scenario simulation are categorized in figures in this data release as (1) within 7 feet of the land surface, (2) within 3 feet of the land surface, or (3) above land surface and are expressed relative to the water-table position simulated in the updated dry- or wet-weather base simulations. The descriptions focus primarily on changes to the distribution of groundwater towards the center of the model domain. Groundwater distributions towards the western edge (west of Grand Blvd.), southwest (south of US-20), and eastern edge (towards Ogden Dunes) of model domain show relatively small variations in the scenario simulations and are outside of the primary area of interest. The scenario of rerouting water from entry into the Gary sanitary sewer system at the weir at site CS-1 to County Line Road ditch through underground pipes (scenario 1a; figs. 3-6) used the MODFLOW Drain Return Package to transmit water from the US-12 ditch to a drain return cell at the intersection of County Line Road ditch and 5th Avenue. This simulated hydrologic modification produced an expanded area of shallow groundwater within 7 feet of the land surface in the areas surrounding the drain return cell location. A small groundwater mound developed in the dry-weather underground pipes simulation at the intersection of County Line Road and 5th Avenue, with the water table within 3 feet of the land surface. In the dry-weather underground pipes simulation (figs. 3 and 4), the portions of the area between Union Street and County Line Road ditch were inundated. Water-table position changes north of US-12 or west of Spencer Street were minimal. In the wet-weather underground pipes simulation (figs. 5 and 6), water ponded at the intersection of County Line Road and East 5th Avenue. Both dry- and wet-weather underground pipes simulations exhibited similar patterns of water-table changes, but differences between water-table positions in the underground pipes and updated wet-weather base simulations were minimal in areas away from the drain return cell. The scenario of diverting water from US-12 ditch to Spencer ditch then trenching to the County Line Road ditch (scenario 1b; figs. 7 and 8) required creation of new drain cells to connect the southern terminus of Spencer ditch to County Line Road ditch at 5th Avenue. These new drain cells were assigned bottom elevations derived from the 2017 ditch elevation survey. The simulated diversion and trench decreased the water table throughout the model domain, particularly in the area south of East 4th Avenue, where expansive areas of shallow groundwater were nearly eliminated. Between Spencer ditch and Union Street, the area of groundwater within 7 feet of the land surface was reduced in both dry- and wet-weather diversion and trench simulations. In most of the area just south of US-12 ditch between the US-12 weir (CS-1) and Union Street, the water table was suppressed to more than 3 feet below the land surface in both scenario simulations. In the wet-weather diversion and trench simulation, flooded areas south of US-12 and west of County Line Road ditch were minimized and changes to the water-table position north of US-12 or east of County Line Road ditch were minimal. The scenario of extending and altering US-12 ditch to flow east towards County Line Road ditch and drain to the Little Calumet River (scenario 2; figs. 9 and 10) required creation of drain cells to connect the two ditches. New drain cells were assigned bottom elevations derived from the 2017 ditch elevation survey which intersected the simulated water table of the updated dry- and wet-weather base simulations. The result from the extended US-12 ditch simulation was a suppression of the water table throughout the model domain, with a pronounced reduction of shallow groundwater between Union Street and County Line Road ditch. In the dry-weather scenario simulation, the occurrence of ponded water was virtually eliminated in the area of interest, while areas simulated to have a water table within 3 feet of the land surface were highly reduced, generally only occurring near West Long Lake, East Long Lake, and along some parts of US-12 ditch. Between Spencer Street and Union Street, there were only limited areas with a water table within 7 feet of the land surface. In the wet-weather scenario simulation, groundwater altitudes were sufficiently suppressed as to eliminate nearly all of the inundated areas west of County Line Road and east of Spencer Street (including most of the areas surrounding West Long Lake). The scenario simulating the installation of a culvert under US-12 to connect US-12 ditch to West Long Lake (scenario 3; figs. 11-14) utilized MODFLOW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Drain Return Package to transmit water removed by the US-12 ditch to a drain return cell in the lake just north of the US-12 and Spencer Street intersection. The general effect of this scenario was a substantial increase in water-table altitude throughout the model domain, particularly north of US-12. In the dry-weather culvert scenario simulation, the West Long Lake basin defined as the vacant area enclosed by US-12 to the south, County Line Road to the east, and Gary neighborhoods to the north was nearly completely inundated. Several areas of ponded water also developed between Union Street and County Line Road Ditch. In both the dry- and wet-weather culvert scenario simulations, shallow groundwater extended north from the West Long Lake basin into nearby Gary residential areas. Some isolated areas of ponded water were simulated in the area north from the lake to Lake Michigan in the wet-weather culvert scenario simulation. East of County Line Road ditch, water-table altitudes increased slightly in both dry- and wet-weather culvert scenario simulations but the extent of shallow groundwater did not change or substantially expand when compared with the updated wet-weather base simulation. Limited water-table position changes were depicted west of Union Street and south of US-12 ditch in both dry- and wet-weather culvert scenario simulations."

There are approximately 4.4 million acres of wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Dakotas that provide essential habitat for wildlife, improve water quality, and provide flood control benefits.  However, these wetlands are increasingly receiving discharges from agricultural tile drainage.  We measured pollutants in tile effluent and evaluated water quality and habitat degradation at Waterfowl Production Areas managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Eighteen wetland sites were periodically sampled from 2011\u20132015.   These sites were divided into three site categories: 1) \u201cTile Wetland\u201d for wetland sites that directly receive tile outfall discharges but may also receive surface runoff of agricultural chemicals, 2) \u201cSurface Wetland\u201d for wetland sites that receive surface runoff of agricultural chemicals but have no known tile discharge inputs, and 3) \u201cReference Wetland\u201d for wetland sites that are well buffered from agricultural chemicals in surface runoff and receive no direct tile outfall discharges.  Wildlife exposed to pollutants discharged by agricultural tile drains or from surface runoff into Refuge wetlands were evaluated by measuring concentrations of pollutants in wetland sediments, water, whole body fish, waterfowl food items (aquatic invertebrates and plants) and mallard duck eggs.  Wetland habitats were evaluated by South Dakota\u2019s Wetland Rapid Assessment Protocol, conducting amphibian surveys and sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates.  Concentrations of nutrients, pesticides and selenium in tile effluent exceeded water quality benchmarks for the protection of aquatic life.  There were also differences in pollutant concentrations between wetland site categories, with Tile Wetlands having higher concentrations of select pesticides, chlorophyll-a, and selenium than Reference Wetlands.  Tile Wetlands also exhibited selenium bioaccumulation in wetland biota (plants, aquatic invertebrates, and duck eggs) and had significantly lower wetland habitat scores and aquatic invertebrate diversity than Reference Wetlands.  We recommend actions to reduce agricultural pollutant discharges into public wetlands."

The Central Valley encompasses an approximate 50,000 square-kilometer region of California. The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) numerical modeling code MODFLOW-FMP (Schmid and others, 2006). This simulation is referred to here as the CVHM (Faunt, 2009). Utilizing MODFLOW-FMP, the CVHM simulates groundwater and surface-water flow, irrigated agriculture, land subsidence, and other key processes in the Central Valley on a monthly basis from 1961-2003. The total active modeled area is 20,334 square-miles on a finite difference grid comprising 441 rows and 98 columns. Slightly less than 50 percent of the cells are active. The CVHM model grid has a uniform horizontal discretization of 1x1 square mile and is oriented parallel to the valley axis, 34 degrees west of north (Faunt, 2009). Groundwater pumpage is a major part of the groundwater budget of the Central Valley, and is grouped into two categories for this study: agricultural and urban (which includes municipal and industrial sources). Discharge from agricultural wells rarely is metered in the Central Valley (Diamond and Williamson, 1983), and therefore must be estimated by indirect means. If consumptive use can be quantified, groundwater pumpage may be estimated by taking into account surface-water supply, irrigation efficiency, and effective precipitation. Irrigation efficiency, as used in this report, is the percentage of water delivered to the Water Balance Subregion (WBS) that is available for consumptive use. The newly developed MODFLOW-FMP uses this method (Schmid and others, 2006). Wells were simulated as a combination of farm wells (Schmid and others, 2006) and multi-node wells (Halford and Hanson, 2002) (Faunt, 2009; fig. C3). Farm wells are simulated in a manner similar to the WEL package (Harbaugh and others, 2000) and the pumpage is distributed among each of the farm wells (Schmid and others, 2006). Agricultural pumpage is estimated through the FMP. A single well that represents the composite of all wells within a model cell is referred to here as a virtual well. For the FMP, in each WBS, a virtual well was placed in each model cell where an irrigated crop was the predominant land use for a given time frame. Because the extent of irrigated agriculture changes through time, wells were added and deleted accordingly in the model during the simulation period. In general, wells were added through time because the extent of irrigated agriculture generally increases through time. In some areas, however, agricultural wells were replaced by urban wells in the model as the land use changed from agricultural to urban. The CVHM is the most recent regional-scale model of the Central Valley developed by the USGS.The CVHM was developed as part of the USGS Groundwater Resources Program (see \"Foreword\", Chapter A, page iii, for details)."

This report provides an overview of the current irrigation and agricultural situation in the Senegal River Valley. Additionally, the report provides a comparison of treatment and comparison households to check for systematic differences between groups at the time of the baseline survey.   In the IWRM, the selection of areas to receive the project interventions was not random. Rather, it was based on a variety of factors, including political, social and environmental. In the absence of random assignment, we will use a Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology combined with propensity score matching (DID-PSM) to estimate the impact of the IWRM activities. The baseline data includes community level and household level data. Community level data includes information about regional and socioeconomic characteristics of the village. Household level data sets were collected in 3 waves, one for each agricultural season.  Mathematica:    Our goal is to propose the most rigorous and feasible evaluation design that answers the following research questions of interest to MCC:   AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION    Have there been changes in the amount of land used for agricultural production? Is land being used for production in different seasons than before?*     Has crop production improved? Have production methods, including the choice of inputs, changed? Have there been changes to the types of crops produced? What factors are contributing to or constraining changes in agriculture inputs and production? Why are households changing or not changing agriculture production decisions, and how do those reasons vary depending on crop type, growing season, or income level? How have changes differed by gender and among different income levels?  USE AND AVAILABILITY OF WATER    Have there been changes in the sources of water used for agricultural production?*     How has water availability changed, and have barriers or costs to accessing irrigation been reduced? Has the water supply become more reliable? Has the amount of irrigated land increased?*  Has the role of WUAs changed and how do they impact the use and availability of water?  INCOME    Have household income levels changed, including changes in components of household income, and has income shifted between agricultural and nonagricultural sources?*  Do farmers perceive an improvement in their living standards?     Have agricultural profits changed?*  LAND SECURITY AND CONFLICTS    Have perceptions of land tenure security changed? Is there increased confidence in the land tenure system? If so, why?  Has the extent of land formalization changed? Is there greater awareness of the process for formalizing land?  Has demand changed for formalized land rights and are the costs of formalizing land rights perceived as reasonable?    Has the number or severity of land conflicts reduced? Has the type or nature of land conflicts changed?*  How has the IWRM Project affected women's access to land and irrigation? How has it affected the landless?     How have changes in land security perceptions, formalization, conflict, or conflict management affected investments on land? What have been the constraints or barriers to land access? Do these differ depending on gender, income levels, or age?  LAND ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE    Have local government agencies become more effective at land management, including land allocation, land formalization, and conflict resolution? Is there greater confidence in the efficacy of these institutions? Do institutions receive adequate support to carry out their functions?  SUSTAINABILITY AND EXTERNAL IMPACTS    What are the prospects for the sustainability of project activities post-Compact?    What impacts did the project have outside of project areas? Who benefitted from each IWRM activity? Where and when did each activity occur?         = Impact analysis using a difference-in-differences methodology      =Descriptive outcomes and implementation analysis using qualitative and quantitative methods    We will address these research questions by using two key analytical methods, as noted in the research question list above. For some research questions, we will employ an impact analysis that uses a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the causal effects of some IWRM Project activities. Through this approach, we will compare beneficiaries (the treatment group) to nonbeneficiaries (the comparison group) before and after the intervention, using existing baseline data and data we plan to collect through two follow-up survey rounds. Due to differences between the two regions and in activities implemented, we will analyze impacts of the project separately for the Delta and Podor intervention areas, using the household as our unit of analysis.  We also will conduct a descriptive outcomes and implementation analysis that uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to address additional questions of interest to complement the impact analysis. These include questions about activities that occurred before the baseline survey and those that occurred at the commune level and may have had commune-wide or institutional effects. We will also use mixed methods to examine the mechanisms that brought about project impacts and to better interpret the estimates produced through the DID analysis. For example, if we find that commune-level activities affected outcomes for both the treatment group and a portion of the comparison group, our DID impact estimates will not be able to capture the effects of these activities; instead, we will examine those commune-level activities and their effects qualitatively. Our mixed-methods analysis will draw on an array of data sources, including the household and community surveys, project documentation, secondary literature, and administrative data provided by MCC and local government agencies. In addition, we will conduct key informant interviews and focus groups with project stakeholders and beneficiary groups."

                "text": "Agricultural Chemical Sourcebook for Wildlife Contaminants Specialists The purpose of this handbook is to provide information to contaminant specialists involved in evaluating agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands. The handbook describes the major types of agricultural chemicals used in the prairie pothole region, their effects on wildlife and habitat, and methods to investigate impacts. Background information on nonpoint source pollution is provided as well as general guidelines on preventing contamination. The handbook begins by introducing safe handling of suspected chemical pollution in wetlands. The description and general uses of agricultural chemicals are discussed next. Major pathways of chemical contamination and effects of pesticides are also covered. This handbook provides technical guidelines for evaluating non-point source contamination of wetlands by agricultural chemicals. The handbook is intended to be a convenient, useful, and comprehensive reference for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel involved in the evaluation of agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands and migratory birds. The handbook also stresses the safety of individuals investigating possible chemical contamination. It is designed to be a ready reference during the planning phase of investigations of agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands. While practices included here are designed for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel, other cooperating agencies or groups may find the information useful when performing similar duties. The handbook may provide guidance to landowners and others wishing to minimize chemical impacts on wildlife as well as provide advice on best management practices. Information in the handbook is based on Federal laws, Executive orders, regulations, Department of Interior policies, and results of scientific research. This handbook has been prepared by the South Dakota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Division for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Offices. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Offices have one or more contaminant specialists that are responsible for evaluating the effects of chemicals on wetlands."

                "text": "Jordan - Water Infrastructure Social Impact (SI) has been contracted by the MCC to measure the impact of the Compact activities on economic and social outcomes. This Impact Evaluation (IE) design report lays out how the SI team aims to establish a causal relationship between program interventions and observed changes in household availability and consumption of different sources of water, household income, household expenditure and household health indicators. It also details our strategy for measuring potential impacts on other sectors (agriculture, utility financial performance, and local enterprises) should these occur in parallel to, or instead of, the expected impacts on households. This IE is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to conduct a rigorous IE design of a large infrastructure project in Jordan. It provides a unique opportunity for the MCC, the GOJ, and the broader development community to understand the impact of a large water investment on income and poverty of urban households and others who are affected by it.  The IE will make every possible attempt to measure the impact of the three inter-linked projects separately, in order for MCC to better understand which component(s) of their investment led to specific changes in outcomes. A comparison of the different impacts will further allow for conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention. It must however be noted that because of the complementarities between these different projects, there are very important limitations in the extent to which the IE design will be able to disentangle the separate impacts of the Water Network Project (WNP), the Wastewater Network Project  (WWNP), the As-Samra Expansion Project (AEP). Since all three projects are being implemented in Zarqa at the same time, often in overlapping locations, there will be complicated interactions among them which may make it difficult to identify the incremental impacts of each individual intervention. In addition, a significant element contributing to the economic logic of the Compact investments - which we discuss more thoroughly throughout this report - is an assumed water efficiency improvement that would stem from substitution of conventional freshwater currently used in irrigated areas in the Jordan Valley with an expanded supply of treated wastewater collected in Zarqa. The full extent of this assumed substitution effect in fact relies on both the water and wastewater network investments and not on the AEP. It is further assumed that the conventional freshwater saved by this substitution would be made available for higher value uses by municipal and industrial users, thereby improving economic outcomes.   For the purposes of presentation, we have grouped similar and complementary data collection activities into three components, which are described in detail in Section E of this report. This presentation is not intended to imply that any of these three specific components are non-essential; indeed we make the case that all are necessary if the goal is to adequately measure and reduce the risks of misattribution in the overall Compact impact. This point is made following our presentation of the IE logic and a subsequent discussion of the overarching evaluation framework unifying the three components, prior to presenting the details of those components.  Overview of the impact evaluation logic  As emphasized in pre-project feasibility studies and economic analyses of the Compact investments, the economic case for the MCC investments rests on a complex and interrelated set of hypothesized changes. The linkages between the various components and intermediate and final outcomes, respectively, are depicted in the IE logic shown in Figure ES.1. It is important to note that Figure ES.1 does not directly follow the categorization of impacts promulgated in previous descriptions of Compact impacts (e.g. accompanying the MCC's economic rate of return analysis), for the following main reasons:  1) The impacts included in those analyses were admittedly non-exhaustive, due to data limitations in quantifying them. (For example, effects on enterprises and/or on property values were omitted from the analyses - see Section D of this report.)    2) The purposes of the IE logic are a) to trace the relationships between projects, intermediate outputs, and final outcomes, b) to illustrate the overlapping relationships between project activities and desired outcomes, and c) to draw attention to the underlying assumptions.  The IE logic aims to identify the set of final outcomes (and to a lesser extent the intermediate outputs) we intend to measure and track through our IE design. Importantly, the so-called primary substitution effect (the increased use of blended KTR water in irrigation in the place of freshwater) is not and cannot be measured or shown as a single outcome. Rather, the quantification of this possible benefit stems from analysis that integrates several outcomes and outputs - to be carried out at the conclusion of the IE using data we proposed to collect - that flow through the following connections: a) reduced physical losses (WNP) and b) increased wastewater capture (WNP and WWNP); which lead to c) increased wastewater use in agriculture and d) substitution of King Talal Reservoir (KTR) water for King Abdullah Canal (KAC) water in the Jordan Valley; which together e) change per-capita use of utility water and lead to f) end-user time savings; g) consumer cost savings; h) aesthetic and health benefits; and i) are capitalized in land values. Similarly, understanding the net value of the secondary substitution effect, or the increased use of network water in place of tanker and/or vended water, flows through a complex chain that includes (not in order of importance), a) improved water quality at the point of delivery and b) changes in per capita use of utility water (due to the factors listed above as well as these quality improvements) which are embedded in reduced purchase of c) tanker water and d) vended water; both of which should ultimately appear as consumer e) cost and f) time savings, but may also result in reduced sales and/or profits in the water tanker and vended water industries. In addition, the extent of these primary and secondary substitution effects will likely be mediated (positively or negatively) by changes in utility performance, itself a function of the delivery of improved services."

                "text": "Survey of organophosphate insecticides in wetlands near Sunflower Fields in South Dakota The Prairie Pothole region of North America contains the most productive waterfowl habitat on the continent. The region also supports intensive agricultural activity that includes routine application of agricultural chemicals to most crops. Insecticides are used mainly on sunflowers, and sunflower acreage in South Dakota has increased more than three-fold since 1990. Parathion is the primary insecticide used on sunflowers and most of it is applied by aerial spraying. Wetlands adjacent to, or encompassed by, sunflower fields are at risk for receiving parathion. Results from the present study suggest that standing water in approximately 25% of the wetlands may contain measurable amounts of parathion. The potential risk to aquatic organisms in wetlands adjacent to sunflower fields is probably underestimated by this study because the detection limit for parathion exceeds the acute limit for the EPA's National Criteria for protection of freshwater organisms. Further study is warranted and should include more sensitive analyses and more attention to factors such as time since last spraying, proximity to sprayed fields, and persistence of parathion in natural wetlands."

It is in the Bear Lake Valley at an elevation of approximately 5,925 feet. This region of Idaho contains 15 phosphate mines owned by 6 different companies, as well as numerous \u201corphaned\u201d mine sites primarily of underground design. One of the inactive, underground phosphate mines, Hot Springs Mine, is located on the southeast corner of the Refuge, across from Mud Lake (Figure 1). Two other sites, the Bloomington Canyon Mine, and Paris Canyon Mine are located upstream of two creeks that flow into the Refuge. Concerns developed over the potential movement of contaminants from these sites into the Refuge when investigations at other phosphate mines in the region indicated that elevated concentrations of contaminants, and in particular selenium, were being released into the environment. In addition, the Refuge is heavily influenced by agricultural return flows and acts as a sediment trap for the Bear River, which is often diverted through the Refuge and into Bear Lake, a natural waterbody now often used for irrigation storage and power generation. This study was undertaken to assess the potential risk to fish and wildlife from contaminants associated with mining and agricultural activities within the Bear Lake Refuge drainage. Several matrices were evaluated for contamination, including: water, sediment, plants, invertebrates, fish, and bird eggs. Sampling sites included surface water inflows to and outflows from the refuge, and several locations within Mud Lake (Figure 1). Chemical analyses included scans for inorganics and organochlorine compounds (OCs) to determine whether contaminants associated with both agricultural with its legacy pollutants, and mining activities are accumulating in sediment and biota on the Refuge. The Bear River and its tributaries entering the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge have a designated beneficial use of coldwater aquatic life and salmonid spawning. Most water quality parameters (i.e. temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc.) were within the range of criterion to support aquatic life. Organochlorine concentrations in sediment, plants, fish, and bird eggs did not appear to be at levels harmful to aquatic resources. No OCs were detected in sediment or plant samples, two OCs were detected at low concentrations in fish tissues (p,p\u2019-DDD and p,p\u2019-DDE), and four OCs were detected at low concentrations in eggs (heptachlor epoxide, p,p\u2019-DDE, total PCBs, and trans-nonachlor). Inorganic concentrations were analyzed in sediment, water, invertebrates, fish, and bird eggs. As with organochlorine compounds, bird egg tissue had low levels of inorganics. However, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, and strontium, were elevated in sediments and exceeded guidelines and/or effects thresholds. Concentrations of lead in invertebrates from Paris Creek were within the range known to cause dietary effects to fish, and zinc levels in fish tissue were well above what is considered to be background and exceeded concentrations reported to cause effects in birds."

During three sampling periods of 5 days each, up to 20 samples per day were collected for Microtox testing, along with basic water quality measurements from each regular site. Sampling periods coincided with intensive aerial applications of pesticides and herbicides on cotton and other crop fields in this predominately agricultural region. Rainfall, and consequently runoff, was lower than anticipated, and perhaps accordingly, no dramatic indications of toxicity were observed for any of the 257 samples screened. The most commonly observed effect was a modestly to substantially greater light output in samples relative to controls. This increased light output may be an indication of a nutrient effect, or it may be a result of stimulatory effects (hormesis) caused by exposure to low levels of potentially toxic agents. An additional study is recommended to more accurately assess the water and sediment quality of these agricultural drains."

                "text": "Nicaragua - Rice and Banana Farmers This report is an impact evaluation of two components of the Rural Business Development Program (RBD) in Nicaragua, specifically the components benefitting rice and plantain farmers on Nicaragua\u2019s Pacific coast. The RBD program helped finance irrigation equipment, inputs, and extension services for plantain producers, as well as extension, inputs, and drying patios for rice producers in 2009 and 2010; the price of rice is a function of its moisture content, and by increasing access to drying patios the RBD program sought to increase the value of sales by producers. Using a unique data set collected for the evaluation, average impacts of the RBD program on participating plantain farmers were estimated using difference-in-differences, while average impacts of the rice component on beneficiaries were estimated using fixed effects regressions. Estimated program impacts were combined with administrative cost data to calculate an internal rate of return for the plantain program and for one aspect of the rice program (construction of drying patios).  Key results of the evaluation are:     -Estimated impacts suggest that the RBD rice program raised yields and revenues by 11% in the 2009 - 2010 growing season and 18% in 2010 - 2011 on average relative to the yields and revenues beneficiaries would have obtained without the program.     -The estimated ERR of the drying patio component of the RBD rice program ranges from 7% under the assumption of a five year lifespan for drying patios to 27% when assuming a 20 year lifespan.     -No ERR was estimated for the input/extension component of the rice program; part of the value of the extension/input bundles received by beneficiaries was to be paid back by each beneficiary farmer to his or her cooperative, and the sum total of payments was to serve as seed money for credit funds managed by cooperatives in future years. The  reliance of future benefits of this program component on farmer repayment performance makes its long-term value uncertain; therefore I chose to focus my ERR calculation on the drying patios.     -While average impacts and the drying patio ERR are both positive, RBD rice program impacts are estimated imprecisely, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that average impacts of the program on yields and revenues were zero.     -Estimated impacts of the RBD plantain program were large and significant for revenues and yields of first quality plantains (harvested plantains come in three different quality grades).     -The average impact of the RBD program on sales suggests that the program raised the value of plantain sales by 72% relative to what beneficiaries would have obtained without the RBD program.     -I use the estimated impact on revenues as well as administrative data on production costs and program costs to estimate the ERR of the plantain program.     -The plantain ERR ranges from -23% when assuming a lifespan of 5 years for irrigation equipment and 13% when assuming a lifespan of 20 years.     -The apparent discrepancy between large impacts on sales and the modest ERR is a reflection of the high cost per beneficiary of the program, which was around $15,062 per farmer for the cohort studied here (around $3.6 million divided by 239 beneficiaries)."

Many of these stands are adjacent to existing jack pine forest ecosystems owned and managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR). The characteristics of these tracts, however, are varied. Almost half of the area of the KWWMA is currently dominated by jack pine that is 5-23 years old, which is the preferred habitat of breeding Kirtland\u2019s Warbler. Our analysis suggests that many of these stands are not optimally stocked to provide high-quality Kirtland\u2019s Warbler habitat. However, songbird surveys on a subset of KWWMA stands in 2006 show that these stands do provide some habitat that is conducive for breeding Kirtland\u2019s Warblers. Furthermore, the diversity of habitats, both in terms of stand age and species composition and structure, suggest that a variety of songbird species, many of which are of conservation concern, are utilizing these habitats.

Current and potential SCINet users are using and generating very large datasets so SCINet needs to be provisioned with adequate data storage for their active computing. It is not designed to hold data beyond active research phases. At the same time, the National Agricultural Library has been developing the Ag Data Commons, a research data catalog and repository designed for public data release and professional data curation. Ag Data Commons needs to anticipate the size and nature of data it will be tasked with handling.    The ARS Web-enabled Databases Working Group, organized under the SCINet initiative, conducted a study to establish baseline data storage needs and practices, and to make projections that could inform future infrastructure design, purchases, and policies. The SCINet Web-enabled Databases Working Group helped develop the survey which is the basis for an internal report. While the report was for internal use, the survey and resulting data may be generally useful and are being released publicly.    From October 24 to November 8, 2016 we administered a 17-question survey (Appendix A) by emailing a Survey Monkey link to all ARS Research Leaders, intending to cover data storage needs of all 1,675 SY (Category 1 and Category 4) scientists. We designed the survey to accommodate either individual researcher responses or group responses. Research Leaders could decide, based on their unit's practices or their management preferences, whether to delegate response to a data management expert in their unit, to all members of their unit, or to themselves collate responses from their unit before reporting in the survey.    Larger storage ranges cover vastly different amounts of data so the implications here could be significant depending on whether the true amount is at the lower or higher end of the range. Therefore, we requested more detail from \"Big Data users,\" those 47 respondents who indicated they had more than 10 to 100 TB or over 100 TB total current data (Q5).  All other respondents are called \"Small Data users.\" Because not all of these follow-up requests were successful, we used actual follow-up responses to estimate likely responses for those who did not respond.    We defined active data as data that would be used within the next six months. All other data would be considered inactive, or archival.    To calculate per person storage needs we used the high end of the reported range divided by 1 for an individual response, or by G, the number of individuals in a group response. For Big Data users we used the actual reported values or estimated likely values."

The study was initiated because refuge personnel had noted an increase in angler pressure in Gertrude Creek and were particularly concerned that the rainbow trout population was being adversely impacted. Rainbow trout were captured by hook and line and sampled to determine age, length, and weight composition, and distribution. Char and Artic grayling were sampled to determine length, weight, and distribution. Special Use Permit reports were used to estimate sport harvest. Sampled rainbow trout fork lengths (FL) ranged from 310-588 mm. Gertrude Creek rainbow trout were primarily represented in the Preferred (400 - 499 mm FL) and Memorable (500 - 599 mm FL) Relative Stock Density (RSD) categories (79%). For comparison, 74% and 61% of the rainbow trout from the Kanektok and Goodnews Rivers on the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge were represented in the Preferred and Memorable RSD categories. Rainbow trout aged using otoliths ranged from 4-11 years. The age and length data suggest the rainbow trout population has not been excessively impacted by fishing. Rainbow trout and char were distributed in the lower 15 km of Gertrude Creek. Arctic grayling were located throughout Gertrude Creek, although primarily in the upper 10 km. Special Use Permit report data only provide a measure of the guided sport fishing activity on the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge. No harvest information on unguided sportfishing were available. In addition, the data provided by the Special Use Permit was not specific enough to estimate the harvest within individual drainage. Modification and expansion of the Special Use Permit or a creel census program would be required to generate harvest estimates."

                "text": "El Salvador - TVET System Reform I. Introduction    The Human Capital Project is one of three projects under the second compact, and it focuses on improving the quality of education and achieving a better match between the supply of skills and the demands of the labor market as they pertain to the international trade of goods and services in El Salvador. The Human Capital Project consists of two activities: (1) the Education Quality Activity, which is intended to improve the quality of the national education system; and (2) the Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) System Reform Activity. The TVET System Reform Activity, with funding of nearly $15 million, is intended to enhance its capacity to harmonize the skills supplied through education and training providers with the skills demanded by the labor market.     MCC contracted with Mathematica to conduct an evaluation of the activities under the Human Capital Project, including the TVET System Reform Activity. Mathematica will conduct a performance evaluation of the TVET System Reform Activity to document its implementation and assess how successful the project was at achieving the intended outcomes. Lessons learned through this performance evaluation will be useful for stakeholders as they continue improving the TVET system, and to inform decisions about the potential expansion of the reform activities to other sectors beyond the sectors focalized by FOMILENIO II.  II. Overview of the Technical  Education and Professional Training System  (TEPT) Activity The revised implementation of this Activity encompasses two main sub activities:     1. Integrated Technical Education and Professional Training Systems Sub-Activity: The revised implementation plan for this sub-activity includes two strategies:         a. Capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. The capacity building strategy has two goals: the first is to enable the private and public sector to identify and manage demands for technical education and professional training. The second is to enable public sector stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of education and training programs to respond quickly and efficiently to private sector labor market demands.     b. Strengthen the link between the supply and demand of technical education and professional training  through the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of information within and between productive sectors , and between private and public institutions in all productive sectors. FOMILENIO II will support the development of sectoral diagnostics to identify the needs of the productive sector, and improve the match between the industries and the training offerings in specified geographic areas. The following are the main tasks for implementing this strategy: 1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; 2) design or update three optional modules of the BTVs with input from the Sectoral Committees; and 3) Establish agreements between companies from the productive sectors and MINED to offer internships for students.    2. Continuous Labor Demand Assessment Sub-Activity. Two strategies encompass the implementation of this sub-activity: 1) establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework; and 2) strengthen the labor market observatory, integrating existing efforts to track labor market conditions.  III. Logic Model    The TEPT Activity in El Salvador is designed to link activities in the systems of technical education and professional training to the needs of the labor market in order to close the gap between training and employment. To that end, TEPT activities are largely focused on facilitating the exchange of information between the supply side and the demand side, both within and between productive sectors. The theory of change behind the implementation of the TEPT Activity states that all of its outputs will increase companies' productivity, and thereby improve workers' wages as well as the employability and socioeconomic standing of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.    1. Activities    The TEPT Activity funded by FOMILENIO II aims to strengthen capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. To that end, this strategy includes (1) creating sectoral committees for technical and educational training, and creating a Sectoral Committee Board to consolidate the demand for professional development in the private sector; (2) offering professional training to workers in the different industrial sectors under the competency-based approach; (3) designing models for certifying workers by competencies and accrediting institutions; (4) creating a Coordination Council of Technical Education and Professional Training to facilitate coordination between public and private organizations involved in technical and professional training, and align the offerings to the skills demanded in the labor market; and (5) establishing procedures and regulations to strengthen the institutional capacity to meet the private sector's demand for technical education and professional training. Implementation of the TEPT Activity includes the design of a roadmap for creating a national qualifications framework, and the development of an information system for the Coordination Council and other bodies to use in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the TEPT Activity.    The TEPT activity also seeks to improve the link between labor demand in the productive sectors with the availability of technical education and vocational training. To achieve this goal, FOMILENIO II plans to: (1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; (2) design at least three modules for the Vocational Technical Baccalaureate in coordination with the Sectoral Committees; and (3) establish agreements between companies from the sectors and MINEDUCYT to offer internships for students.     2. Short- and medium-term outcomes    Once the sectoral committees and the Board of Sectoral Committees are in existence, and a model for certification and accreditation has been implemented, the private sector will improve its capacity to identify and influence the professional training that is available to prospective trainees. Designing modules for the Professional Technical Baccalaureate, and creating the Coordination Council of TEPT will also improve the linkage between the demands of the productive sector, and the availability of technical education and vocational training.     3. Long-term outcomes    In the long term, the TEPT Activity is expected to improve the government's capacity to plan and evaluate the offer of technical education and professional training assisted by the MNC and the information system developed for subsequent planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the improved match between labor demand in the industrial/private sectors and the technical training available to the potential workforce will improve the productivity of companies, and therefore increase workers' wages. It is also expected to improve the employability of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.  IV. Evaluation design    The aims of the performance evaluation are to (1) assess progress toward the short- and medium-term outcomes that the program was designed to achieve and (2) understand and document the implementation of the Technical Education and Professional Training activities. To meet these two overarching aims, the performance evaluation will include a pre-post analysis of program outcomes and an implementation study.    A. Pre-post design.    The single group pre-post design consists of obtaining data for the outcomes of interest prior to (or at the beginning of) TEPT training (pre) and the same measure after participation in the TEPT courses (post). The pre-post study will focus on measuring the changes on labor market outcomes, and assessing to what extent work conditions, wages, and employment status improved for those who participated in the TEPT programs.     B. Implementation study     The implementation study will focus on describing all components of the TEPT program and their operation and identifying progress towards short- and medium-term outcomes of the program. We will document how program components were implemented, explore the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation of TEPT sub-activities, and describe the main program outputs of the TEPT System. We will also identify short- and long-term achievements and sustainability efforts related to each TEPT sub-activity.  V. Evaluation research questions    The pre-post study will focus on three descriptive research questions:    1. Did employee work conditions, benefits or non-wage compensation, change for trainees who participated in the TEPT courses approximately six to nine months after the courses ended?     2. Did wages change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    3. Did employment status change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    We will examine five main overarching research questions through the implementation study:    1. How were the TEPT sub-activities implemented, and what were the major facilitators and barriers to implementation?    2. Were some sectors more successful implementing the TEPT activities than others?    3. Which outputs were accomplished for each sub-activity, and to what extent did they meet the targets?     4. Which short- and long-term outcomes were accomplished for each sub-activity?     5. What are the plans for the institutional and financial sustainability of the services offered and the entities created as part of the TEPT activity?  VI. Data sources and analysis plan    A. Pre-post study:     Data sources.     The primary data source for the performance evaluation will be the trainee tracer survey. In collaboration with FOMILENIO II, we will field the pre-training tracer survey (baseline) with about 500 participants who are enrolled in TEPT courses, either prior to or within one month of their course initiation. TEPT courses will be rolled out starting the second quarter of 2019. Because the timing for the rollout will vary, baseline data collection will take place on a rolling basis and will be aligned with the course rollout plan for the prioritized sectors. We plan to conduct the baseline survey as a Computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ) with groups of enrolled trainees at their training sites and the follow-up survey as an individual, face-to-face, computer-administered questionnaire at respondents' work sites or homes. We will collect the follow-up survey six to nine months after the course ends by following a staggered timeline similar to the baseline data collection. The follow-up survey is expected to start in mid-2020 and to extend beyond the compact period.     Analyses.     To assess changes in work conditions, wages, and employment status sometime after participants should have completed the TEPT training programs, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the tracer survey data for trainees in FOMILENIO II-supported courses. We will compare key outcome indicators at baseline and follow-up for each trainee-level outcome and report averages (mean percent change) for the full sample of trainees and also by gender. We will also describe the background trainee characteristics, such as gender, age, and education level. The analysis will include a cross-sector comparison of participant characteristics and implementation milestones.    B. Implementation study    Data sources.     We will draw on three sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on outputs and achievements of the TEPT activity: (1) stakeholder interviews, (2) program monitoring data, and (3) a document review.     Analyses.     a. Analytic approach for quantitative program implementation data. We will conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on monitoring data to summarize the program outputs and understand short-term and long-term program achievements.    b. Analytic approach for qualitative program implementation data. We will prepare interview and focus group transcripts and conduct thematic analysis in two sequential steps. The first step involves conducting data reduction and mapping transcript segments to the core performance research questions. The second step involves thematic framing-the process of distilling themes and identifying patterns in qualitative data. We will develop a coding framework with a hierarchy of conceptual categories that are linked to the research questions and the program logic model. We will also create thematic memos for data synthesis and interpretation of key findings.     To take advantage of the complementarity that a mixed-methods approach affords, we will integrate findings from descriptive quantitative analysis of monitoring and administrative data with findings from qualitative data sources. We will summarize program outputs and outcomes from FOMILENIO II's administrative records and implementation reports by using data abstraction templates that we will design for this study. We will also create summary tables of qualitative findings from key stakeholder interviews. Then, we will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings by using triangulation techniques to (1) assess the consistency of the findings across methods and data sources, (2) confirm patterns of findings, and (3) identify potential discrepancies across data sources. Furthermore, information from the qualitative data collection related to barriers and facilitators to program implementation will help us interpret the findings from the quantitative analysis."

The CO2 measurement uses a bubble equilibrator (Sutton et al., 2014), where the air from the equilibrator headspace is circulated through a LI-COR 820 non-dispersive infrared detector (NDIR) for measurement of CO2. The system carries out an automated measurement sequence every 2 or 3 hours, depending on the instrumentation setup. At the beginning of each measurement sequence, the NDIR undergoes a two point calibration with a zero CO2 gas and a high CO2 standard span gas (typically 450-550 micromol/mol), which bracket the range of CO2 mole fractions in seawater and air. The zero CO2 gas is generated by cycling air through a soda lime chamber and silica gel to remove CO2 and water vapour, respectively. The CO2 span gas is prepared by the NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory in the USA and calibrated on the WMO X2007 scale with a standard deviation of 0.06 micromol/mol. Each measurement cycle of zero and span gas, equilibrator headspace, and air takes 20 minutes with the equilibrator headspace measurement occurring at about 17 minutes followed by the air measurement. The pressure measurements are considered the same for the equilibrator headspace gas and air measurements due to the design of the MapCO2 system (Sutton et al., 2014) as are the temperature and salinity of the surface seawater and the equilibrator measured by the Seabird SBE16PlusV2. NCEI Accession 0165305 includes chemical, meteorological, physical time series data collected from MOORING Maria_Island_42S_148E deployment in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean from 2012-04-17 to 2012-10-18. These data include mole fraction of CO2 in the equilibrator head space, mole fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere, fugacity of carbon dioxide at surface water, corrected for water vapour at surface water salinity and temperature, delta fCO2 = (fCO2_WET_SW - fCO2_WET_AIR), atmospheric pressure, equilibrator pressure, sea surface temperature, equilibrator temperature, sea surface salinity and concentration O2 in surface sea water."

Avoiding the expense and safety risks associated with system failures is certainly a top priority in many systems; however, there is also a strong motivation not to be overly cautious in the design and maintenance of systems, due to the expense of maintenance and the undesirable sacrifices in performance and cost effectiveness incurred when systems are over designed for safety. This paper describes an analytical process that starts with the derivation of an expression to evaluate the desirability of future control outcomes, and eventually produces control routines that use uncertain prognostic information to optimize derived risk metrics. A case study on the design of fault-adaptive control for a skid-steered robot will illustrate some of the fundamental challenges of prognostics-based control design."

Analysis of biological samples is in progress. Retrieved harvest consisted of 961 walruses (36% males, 39% females, and 25% calves). An average of 8.3 walruses were retrieved per hunter. Loss rates for animals shot in the water were between 6-18% for animals shot on the ice. Loss rates were highest for males and lowest for calves. Total harvest (including possible sunk and lost) was estimated to be between 1118 and 1301 animals. An estimated average of 55% of the walruses harvested were utilized solely for their ivory and an average of 45% were utilized for other parts along with the ivory. Percent utilization of specific walrus parts varied highly by the type of part but was highest for calves (100%) and lowest for vibrissae (1%). Herd size was found to affect an animal's vulnerability in being-harvested. Animals in herds of 1-2 were most vulnerable (90-100% retrieved). Vulnerability dropped as herd size increased and males (in all male herds) were found to be less vulnerable than females (in female/young herds). Of all factors, wind velocity affected hunting occurrence and success the most, followed by ice conditions, and then by weather (fog, rain, snow). During the migration male walruses predominated to the E and NE of Gambell and to the NW close to the Siberian coastline. Females, sub-adults, and calves predominated to the N and NW (in the middle of Anadyr Strait). The height of the harvest and probably the migration occurred between 12 and 23 May. The ice pack was substantially broken up by this time, allowing hunters better access to walrus and allowing walrus an open path through Bering Strait."

                "text": "SMES Cryptogam Crust Data Introduction. Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson & Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown & Heske 1990, Brown & Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson & Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger & Brown 1981, Brown & Zeng 1989, Brown & Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers."

Samples of sediments, snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) tissues, wood duck (Aix sponsa) and hooded merganser (Lophodytes cacullatus) eggs, and fish were collected at various locations on the refuge and two contiguous New York State Wildlife Management Areas. All samples were analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals/trace elements. All hydrocarbon compounds tested for were either not detected or were measured at levels that do not pose an apparent threat to the eagles. The levels of inorganic elements in sediments exhibited considerable variation, as expected, but no serious elevations were apparent. Inorganic levels in the various tissue matrices were virtually all below levels of concern. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that no significant threat to the eagles from environmental contaminants exists at this time. A recommendation has been made that samples of fish, the primary food of the eagles, be periodically collected and analyzed for contaminants of concern. This study was completed by the New York Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Cortland, New York with the funding and assistance of the Division of Refuges and Wildlife."

                "text": "SMES rabbit survey data Introduction. Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson & Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown & Heske 1990, Brown & Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson & Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger & Brown 1981, Brown & Zeng 1989, Brown & Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers."

The refuge contains over 1000 acres of this habitat and many more acres occur on private land adjacent to the refuge. These prairie remnants occur in a unique landscape consisting of mounds and swales. Most of the moundshave been invaded by a host of weed species as a result of past grazing.

In conjunction, the current availability of methylmercury (the form of mercury toxic to animals and humans) in aquatic ecosystems is at levels posing risks to human and ecological health. Risk levels vary considerably in response to methylmercury availability, which is affected by lake hydrology, biogeochemistry, habitat, topography, and proximity to airborne sources. The Common Loon was selected as a suitable bioindicator of aquatic mercury toxicity, based on ecological, logistical, and other criteria, including public valuations of natural resources. In New York State, loons were sampled opportunistically in the Adirondack Park from 1998-2000. Based on risk categories developed from the literature and in situ studies by BioDiversity Research Institute and their collaborators, 17% of the breeding loon population in New York is estimated to be at risk from mercury contamination. Loons in the high risk categories were captured on acidic, low alkalinity lakes in the Adirondack Park that had low levels of dissolved organic carbon. As has been found elsewhere in the Northeast, blood mercury levels in adult birds were higher than those in juvenile loons, and adult male loons had higher blood and feather mercury levels than did females. Higher blood and feather mercury levels in male loons reflect both the ability of females to depurate mercury into eggs and the tendency of males to eat larger fish than females. The results of the sampling efforts in New York are coordinated with contaminant sampling in loons throughout the Northeast to better assess the neurologic, behavioral, and physical impacts of mercury toxicity on loons. Population models based on related studies in the Northeast indicate that mercury toxicity has potential to negatively impact breeding loon populations by reducing overall reproductive success. Thus, in New York, it is recommended that population monitoring and contaminant sampling of breeding loons continue through the efforts of the newly established Adirondack Cooperative Loon Program. Such population monitoring programs and continued refinement of population models enable the early detection of declining population trends and the implementation of management efforts, as well as assisting in state and national policies and regulations that reflect the ecological injury mercury is currently having on the freshwater landscape. Results of blood lead levels from loons sampled in New York from 1998-2000 are still pending. Dead loons found by the general public were forwarded to the NYS Wildlife Pathology Laboratory for necropsy analysis. Lead toxicity due to the ingestion of lead fishing tackle accounted for 20% of the mortality in loons necropsied by the NYS Wildlife Pathology Laboratory. Currently, legislation is under consideration in New York to regulate the sale and use of lead fishing tackle. Passage of these bills would eventually reduce the quantity of lead sinkers deposited in New York waterbodies, which should significantly decrease the chances of waterbirds, such as loons, ingesting lead sinkers and developing lead toxicity."

Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson & Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown & Heske 1990, Brown & Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson & Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger & Brown 1981, Brown & Zeng 1989, Brown & Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers."

In New York, the species has recently been reclassified from \"special concern\" to \"endangered\".  Historically, in New York, black tern colonies were located in marshes along the shores of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, inland marshes in the western, central, and northeastern parts of the state, and an isolated site in the Adirondack Mountains. Today, the statewide population averages less than 300 breeding pairs and colonies in central New York, the Adirondacks, and Lake Ontario shores near Buffalo no longer exist.  The goal of the habitat data analysis was to find the best fit model to explain the relationship between the response variable (ie, presence/absence of a nest or nest marsh/non-nest marsh) and the predictor variables (measured habitat variables from plots)."

The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%). In contrast, most jointly-owned enterprises had acquired plots through transfer from someone for cash (32.6%), followed by public sector agency grants (26.3%).  A significant proportion (69.8%) of enterprises did not have formally registered titles/documents to the premises that they used; The top reason for opting to rent/sublease business premises was not intending to acquire land, which was mentioned by 35.1 percent of enterprises. The second reason was of enterprises that did not qualify to hold land in Lesotho, which was mentioned by 23.2 percent of enterprises Majority (67.2 percent) of enterprises did not have occupational insurance. Over 50 percent of the enterprises did not have all the policies. Workers in 83.5 percent of all enterprises did not have access to a health and safety officer.  In 88.3 and 91.7 percent of all enterprises, workers did not have access to a counselor and services of a Social Worker, respectively. Workers in 32.6 percent of all enterprises did not have break hours.  As high as 86.4 percent of the enterprises lost between one (1) and 30 days to sick leave in the last twelve months.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers."

Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) contains over 3400 km (2000 mi) of pristine waterways. As streams drain the forested ecosystems of the Park, they integrate and reflect conditions in those ecosystems. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are subjected directly to changes in the physical and chemical conditions of the water, and because of this dependent relationship with the water they live in, aquatic macroinvertebrates are good indicators of ecosystem health. They are found in all aquatic environments, are less mobile than many other groups of organisms, and are of a size that makes them easily collectable. Moreover, benthic macroinvertebrates have been shown to be a cost-effective monitoring tool (Lenat 1988). Aquatic biota exhibit responses to a wide array of stressors, including those having synergistic or antagonistic effects. In the Smokies, these stressors include primarily acid deposition and forest changes due to exotic pest infestations. The overall goal of this program is to maintain a Park-wide system of benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring sites to track the environmental health of Park streams, and to detect and quantify changes in conditions. The specific objectives are: to develop long-term aquatic biota data for large streams; to determine correlations among macroinvertebrates, fish, habitat, and water quality monitoring data; and to develop baseline data on aquatic macroinvertebrates.When conducting a monitoring program, the main goal is to analyze long-term data to evaluate changes in condition, and progress toward meeting a management objective. The aquatic macroinvertebrate monitoring program in GRSM is designed to provide this data through repeated sampling over time to answer the question of whether or not a particular benthic macroinvertebrate population displays trends indicative of ecosystem stress. This data relates directly to many other Inventory and Monitoring components in the Park, particularly the fisheries and water quality programs. Additionally, this data provides a baseline dataset for many areas outside of the Park which may be experiencing greater impacts to their aquatic resources.Benthic macroinvertebrates represent an integral part of lotic systems by processing organic matter and providing energy to higher trophic levels; therefore, an understanding of the effects of anthropogenic, as well as natural stressors, on their distribution and abundance is critical for comprehensive impact assessment of streams and rivers (Carter et al. 2006). Changes in macroinvertebrate population relative abundances, life-history traits, and growth rates are sensitive indicators of perturbations and are routinely used when evaluating the impacts of pollution (Carter et al. 2006). The deleterious effects of acidic stream water, for example, are well established, primarily in terms of reduced numbers of species and individuals (Allan 1995). Direct physiological effects and mortality due to acidification and to the subsequent mobilization of toxic metals, have been observed among various groups of aquatic invertebrates (Burton et al. 1985). Indirect effects of acidification also occur, through behavioral responses and alterations of food availability (Allan 1995)."

The NSRDB update is a collection of hourly values of the three most common measurements of solar radiation (i.e., global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal) over a period of time adequate to establish means and extremes and at a sufficient number or locations to represent regional solar radiation climates. Nearly all of the solar data in the NSRDB are modeled, and only 40 sites have measured solar data - none of them with a complete period of record. Because of the data-filling methods used to accomplish the goal of serial completeness, NSRDB meteorological data are not suitable for climatological work. The meteorological fields in the NSRDB should be used only as ancillary data for solar deployment and sizing applications. Filled/interpolated meteorological data should not be used for climatic applications. (All such data are flagged.) The serially complete hourly data provided in the NSRDB update are provided in two output formats: 1) ground-based solar and meteorological dataset, and 2) 10 km gridded output produced by the SUNY model. The 1991-2010 NSRDB is an update of the 1991-2005 NSRDB released in 2006 and archived at NCDC. The updated NSRDB dataset an hourly ground-based data set of solar and meteorological fields for 1454 stations. The primary provider for ground-based data is NCDC, which are stored as site-year files in comma-separated value (CSV) American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. Station identification numbers use the six-digit United States Air Force (USAF) station ID numbering scheme. The measured solar radiation data came from multiple sources, including: Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program, Department of Energy Florida Solar Energy Center, State of Florida Integrated Surface Irradiance Study and Surface Radiation Budget Measurement Networks, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Air Resources Laboratory and Earth System Research Laboratory Global Monitoring Division Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory University of Oregon Solar Radiation Monitoring Laboratory Network University of Texas Solar Energy Laboratory. All meteorological data were provided by the National Climatic Data Center from its Integrated Surface Hourly Database (ISD) product. The NSRDB Statistics Files hold summary statistics for all Class I and Class II stations. The Daily Statistics provide monthly and annual averages of solar radiation and several meteorological parameters for both annual and a 20 year roll-up. The Hourly Statistics provide average diurnal profiles by hour for each station year for each solar parameter. The Persistence Statistics provide multiple levels of persistence for up to 30 days for each station for each solar parameter. These Summary Statistics files are documented in the NSRDB User's Manual."

It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

These five phases differ slightly from the six main steps identified in the IGP grant manual; however, all of the activities reflected in the grant cycle implementation figure (p. 19 of the grants manual) are included in the five phases below. We chose to establish slightly different grant cycle implementation phases so the performance evaluation can address a critical element not reflected in the IGP manual's phases: \u201crevising the process.\u201d This phase is a critical component of the performance evaluation of the IGP facility.    AIR's performance evaluation of the IGP is structured around the five phases of IGP implementation mentioned above. AIR will use the following overarching questions as a framework to the evaluation question design:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   Did the IGP adhere to its objectives:    1.  To increase and sustain the access of the poor to quality water and sanitation and improved drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    2.  To enhance the functioning of the water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems?    3.  To demonstrate an innovative approach or technology to improve water use, sanitation, and hygiene practices among the poor?    4.  To identify and provide assistance to innovative partnership arrangements, particularly through private sector engagement?    5.  To provide significant access by women and vulnerable groups to the IGP and its benefits?    6.  To expand opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generating activities related to water supply, sanitation, and drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    \u00b7   Did the grant selection process prioritize interventions based on its key objectives, and was process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects?    \u00b7   Is grant oversight sufficient?  Is it cost-effective?    \u00b7   How can the Innovation Grant Program better mobilize private-sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCC specifically or another organization best replicate this program?    Start-up: During start- up, we will investigate the effectiveness of the IGP solicitation process to potential grantees. Another key area of interest will be gathering the demographic information of the grantees. The evaluation of the IGP's start-up phase will be based on the questions below:    \u00b7   What is the implementation plan for the grants?    \u00b7   How is information about the program disseminated?     \u00b7   Have there been specific outreach and dissemination activities targeting potential grantees that are best qualified to provide high quality services to women's groups, poor communities, and new entrepreneurs?    \u00b7   Does the MCA provide assistance with grant development, funding guidelines, and budgeting?     \u00b7   Does MCA facilitate connections between (potential) applicants or between applicants and government agencies?    \u00b7   Do targeted communities and stakeholders understand the intention and structure of the grant program?     \u00b7   What is the proportion of grantees from each technical intervention area (i.e. solid waste removal)?     \u00b7   What are potential grantees' and their communities' expectations of the program?     \u00b7   How well informed are potential grantees of the application and selection process, and of the available resources and support to help them participate?    \u00b7   How many grantees apply and how many applications do grantees submit?    \u00b7   How many applications meet the basic qualifications for participation in the program?     \u00b7   Do the interventions supported by the IGP clearly benefit poor communities, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs?     \u00b7   To what extent do the number and nature of applications meet MCA expectations?     \u00b7   To what extent do the applications cover a broad range of services and service areas?    \u00b7   Are proposals received highly relevant to the proposal call area and well distributed across the different calls areas?     \u00b7   Do the problem statements and proposal calls address areas that key IGP stakeholders perceive to be high impact?    Selection: During selection, we will investigate the selection process of the IGP with particular focus on the scoring procedures of the grants. Additionally, AIR will also examine the ways in which selection decisions are communicated to the grantees. Selection questions include:    \u00b7   Does IGPM follow its rules for reviewing, rating, and ranking grant applications?     \u00b7   Are the reviewers adequately trained and supported?     \u00b7   Is the review process fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of potential grantees?    \u00b7   Are grantees notified of the grant decision in a timely and effective way?    \u00b7   Are grantees provided with feedback that enables them to improve their grant application and resubmit?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants understand and accept the outcome of the selection process?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants plan to resubmit revised applications?     \u00b7   Are rejected applicants requesting assistance with resubmission?     \u00b7   How many grants are awarded?     \u00b7   What is the average grant size?     \u00b7   What proportion of available funds is committed to accepted grants?     \u00b7   Is the grant selection process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects based on how the projects align with IGP investment criteria?     Implementing the award: During the implementation phase, we will investigate the process of implementing the award. AIR will closely examine the negotiations of grantees' contracts, the process in which funds are disbursed, and the ability of grantees to successfully meet their quarterly goals. Illustrative research questions include:    \u00b7   How did the negotiations of the contract impact the implementation of the award?     \u00b7   Are grantees adequately supported with necessary technical and managerial assistance?    \u00b7   Are funds transmitted to grantees in a timely and efficient way?     \u00b7   Are grantee spending and performance adequately and efficiently monitored?    \u00b7   Do grantees receive timely feedback on their performance?     \u00b7   How does MCA monitor its own performance in the operation of the grant program?    \u00b7   Is MCA meeting its own expectations for successful implementation of the grant program?     \u00b7   How well is the grant program integrated into other compact activities?    \u00b7   What proportion of awarded grant funds is spent on time and on target?     \u00b7   What proportion of grantees achieves their performance objectives at various points throughout the grant period?    \u00b7   Is MCA's oversight of the grants sufficient and cost effective in terms of spending and M&E targets? \u00b7   Does MCA-Zambia/IGPM verify that applicants have met quarterly milestones before awarding the conditional grant disbursements?     \u00b7   What percentages of applicants fail to receive disbursements on time due to failure to meet quarterly milestones?    Completing the award: During the completion phase of the award, we will investigate the sustainability and impact of the grantees' programs. In particular, how effective IGP efforts were in increasing access to clean water and sanitation to vulnerable communities. AIR will pay particular attention to grantees' ability to successfully sustain its programs efforts and the impacts of these programs on their catchment communities. As part of these efforts, AIR will examine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders regarding grantees' programs. However, it is important to note that a full assessment of IGP may not be possible due to the short timeframe.  Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   What proportion of grantees is still active in business at the end of the grant period?    \u00b7   What proportions of the grants demonstrate potentially viable, long-term, profit-generating business opportunities?     \u00b7   How do civil society organizations and policy makers perceive the changes the program has made to the overall infrastructure for water, sanitation, and drainage services in Lusaka?    \u00b7   How aware of the program are households, civil society organizations, policy makers, and other water and sanitation focused stakeholders?     \u00b7   Has the grantee spurred \u201ccopycat\u201d organizations?    \u00b7   Did the grantees feel that they received adequate time to thoroughly complete all of the interventions?    \u00b7    To what extent are the benefits of the program cited as reasons for larger systemic changes by policy makers and compact implementing entities?     \u00b7   What is policy makers and compact implementing entities' perception of the extent to which the program has created individual interventions and structures that are sustainable even after program funding ends?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new partnerships between organizations in water, sanitation, or solid waste value chain?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new private sector investment in the sector?    \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new/ refined models of pro-poor service delivery?     \u00b7   What is the perception of benefits to the poor and vulnerable populations?     Revising the process: During this phase, AIR will investigate IGP's ability to successfully meet its objectives. As part of this process, AIR will examine the ways in that the IGP process could be further improved. Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   How can the IGP better mobilize private sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCA specifically or another organization best replicate this program?"

Ocean acidification, the progressive change in ocean chemistry caused by uptake of atmospheric CO2, is likely to affect some marine resources negatively, including shellfish. The Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports one of the most economically important single-species commercial fisheries in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification.

                "text": "NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County: United States This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality.    Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.    Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).    REFERENCES    1.

Little is known, however, of the impacts of the other driftnet fisheries on seabirds in the North Pacific. The collective impacts of all these fisheries may be significant. It is clear that in some years thousands of breeding birds are killed in the mothership fishery although we have been unable to demonstrate that these losses are decreasing populations of breeding birds in the western Aleutian Islands. We recommend that a no fishing zone be established around the western Aleutian Islands. This fishing-free zone would decrease the mortality of both breeding and non-breeding seabirds in the U.S. Fishery Conservation Zone. Based on the results of our research, we suggest that a closure out to 50-60 nautical miles may be appropriate."

No other area in the eastern United States has a comparable number of seabird nesting colonies. Most of the offshore nesting islands are low-lying granite outcrops or drowned mountaintops. Gulls, cormorants, and eiders nest in substantial numbers offshore, while others such as terns, razorbills, puffins, and petrels are less common and more sensitive to environmental changes.

Efforts are to focus on detecting, treating, and monitoring new infestations of highest priority invasive plants. Several priority species pose a substantial threat and require an early detection rapid response program to preclude new infestations from becoming established. These include Spartina on and around Grays Harbor NWR and wild chervil and purple loosestrife on the Black River Unit of Nisqually. Monitoring and mapping of more established and widespread weeds such as Phragmites, Japanese knotweed, and tansy ragwort would also be of benefit. The program hinged on getting anSCA intern to coordinate the large volunteer effort to detect, map and monitor invasives utilizing existing Refuge GPS and GIS capabilities to collect data and maintain databases and maps."

This observer program is continuing. Selected salmon gillnet fisheries in Alaska were monitored in 1990 and 1991, and monitoring of seabird mortality in the shellfishery in the Bering Sea/ Aleutian Islands region was initiated in 1994. The estimated annual incidental mortality of seabirds in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island and Gulf of Alaska longline, trawl, and pot groundfish from 1989 through 1993 was 9,600 birds, of which about 8,200 birds were killed in the Bering Sea and about 1,400 birds in the Gulf of Alaska. About 88X of the birds in all 6 fisheries were caught in the longline fishery. Northern Fulmars were 55X of the total mortality in the Bering Sea and 67X of the total mortality in the Gulf of Alaska in 1993. Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses accounted for 7X and 14X of the total mortality in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, respectively. The two salmon gillnet fisheries monitored in Alaska accounted for a total estimated annual seabird mortality of about 1,567 birds. About 52% of the observed mortality in Prince William Sound was Marbled Murrelets, and 50% of the observed mortality in the South Unimak Pass salmon fishery was Common Murres."

Conte NFWR threatens many of the resources and habitats that the refuge is tasked with protecting. Both the wetlands and forest habitat continue to be impacted by invasive plants. For example, invasive shrubs such as Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) already existed on the Fort River Division and on the surrounding private lands of the Salmon River Division. Efforts to stop the spread of Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) on the Salmon River Division and the invasive shrubs on the Fort River Division were already underway at the time of the inventory. An inventory of these and other invasive plants at Silvio O. Conte NFWR will improve strategic planning and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of invasive plant management operations already occurring on the refuge. As part of the pilot project, Utah State University was asked to conduct an inventory for targeted invasive non-native plants within portions of these three new divisions of the refuge. While the purpose of the larger project is to develop a guide for conducting inventories on refuges, this inventory also provided valuable information to meet the invasive species management goals established at Silvio O.

The NOAA Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate Format) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive, starting with data date 7 February, 2000.  The leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).  The data contain  globally-merged (60S-60N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8).  The data have been corrected for \"zenith angle dependence\", i.e. IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects.  This correction allows for the merging of the IR data from the various geostationary satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at their boundaries.  Some residual differences among the data exist since the IR channels aboard the various spacecraft have slightly different characteristics and no intercalibration among the sensors has been performed. NOAA are in the process of performing such an intercalibration, although this effect is considerably smaller than the zenith angle effects.  The NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface.   Similarities with the original As in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution.   Differences from the original  The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines.    To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South).    The data and time units are reflected in the corresponding \"units\" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude (\"lon\"), latitude (\"lat\") and \"time\" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple \"ncdump\" or \"h5dump\" command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.  Acknowledgements The creation of the original data at NOAA/NCEP is supported by funding from the NOAA Office of Global Programs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and by NASA via the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).   The permanent archive at GES DISC is supported by NASA's HQ Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program."

Further, the shortcomings of the present programs will be used as a basis for an expanded program that can ease the major problems more rapidly and efficiently. Many problems of the fishing industries are very complex. Some result from limitations in the raw resource, some from traditional methods of fishing, processing, and marketing, and some from greatly increased imports of low-cost foreign fishery products. A problem of particular importance to Alaska is the rapidly expanding foreign fishing activity on international stocks located close offshore. Fleets of Russian and Japanese trawlers are taking immense catches of bottomfish from the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Both countries have also begun fishing king crab and shrimp in these waters, and indications are that their operations will be rapidly expanded in the near future. These foreign fishing activities are of great significance not only to the state of Alaska, but to the entire country as well. Representatives of the Alaskan fishing industries were interviewed to obtain their views and suggestions concerning the Regional program, A primary function of the interviews was to assure that the Region's present activities are well oriented with the problems and needs of the various industries. In general, it was found that the present program of the Region was well aligned with the needs of the industry, although industry members pointed out several problems requiring attention that are not now under study. These suggestions were used as a basis for drawing up the expanded programs listed in this report."

Initially, observers were placed on vessels only upon invitation by host countries. In the early years of the program the primary purposes of observers were to determine incidental catch rates of Pacific halibut in groundfish catches and to verify catch statistics in the Japanese crab fishery. Later, observers collected data on the incidence of king crab, snow (Tanner) crab, and Pacific salmon, and obtained biological data on other important species. Following the implementation of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, which mandated that fishery observers be placed on foreign fishing vessels operating within the US 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the Alaska coast of the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, observer coverage rapidly expanded.  By 1986, the foreign fisheries that were not joint-venture were halted."

Its 175 residents, most of whom are lflupiaq speaking Eskimos, have strong cultural links to lands in and adjacent to the northern part of the refuge and are culturally and economically dependent on the refuge's wildlife resources. Kaktovik is one of the eight villages belonging to the North Slope Borough, which is the regional governing entity headquartered in Barrow. Modern in many respects, there is also ample evidence of its dependence on the land's resources. New pick-up trucks are parked next to piles of whale maktak. Racks of drying ugruk meat extend from just completed modern four bedroom houses, and caribou hides are draped over snowmachines parked in front yards. North Slope Borough construction and services offer jobs where residents are regularly employed, but work schedules are flexible enough to allow for subsistence activities, and people hunt and fish on weekends and during vacations. Continuing petroleum development on the North Slope and its possible extension to the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge have focused attention on the people of Kaktovik and their subsistence way of life. In order to make optimum resource allocation decisions and minimize petroleum related impacts, it is important to know as much as possible about these peoples' past and present uses of the land and wildlife and the values associated with these uses. This report documents, from the viewpoint of the people of Kaktovik, historic and present land use and associated values in the general area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."

Mist net and roost surveys were conducted from March 2002- February 2007 to determine the distribution and relative abundance of Rafinesque's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) and southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius) in Mississippi. Mist net surveys were conducted at 9 study areas in 12 counties from March 2002- August 2006. A total of 425 bats were captured representing 8 species. Twenty nine Rafinesque's big-eared bats, representing 7% of all captures, were captured at 2 study areas (St. Catherine Creek National Wildlife Refuge [NWR] and Camp Shelby). Thirty-three southeastern myotis, representing 8% of all captures, were captured at 6 study areas (St. Catherine Creek NWR, Camp Shelby, Noxubee NWR, Meridian Naval Air Station, Caney Creek Wildlife Management Area and Laurel Hill Plantation). To determine relative abundance and roost preferences for Rafinesque's big-eared bat and southeastern myotis, abandoned buildings, culverts, cisterns, and caves were surveyed in select locations in 17 counties in Mississippi. Seven abandoned buildings located on St. Catherine Creek NWR, Adams County, were surveyed 2 - 9 times a month from August- October 2002 and March- October 2003. Rafinesque's big-eared bat individuals used all 7 buildings as roosts, 3 of which were confirmed maternal colonies. One of these maternal roosts contained 50 individuals in July 2003. Six of the 7 roosts were also used by southeastern myotis with a maximum of 5 individuals observed in 1 of the roosts in June 2003. Four artificial bat houses constructed at St. Catherine Creek NWR specifically designed to attract Rafinesque's big-eared bat (1 shed design and 3 artificial tree designs), were surveyed in April and July 2005, February, May, and August 2006, and March 2007. Bats were never observed in the shed design artificial roost. One to 2 Rafinesque's big-eared bats were observed in each of the artificial tree roosts on several occasions, with 1 roost containing 48 individuals in August 2006. Two abandoned houses on Noxubee NWR, Noxubee County, were surveyed in May 2004 and were found to contain 2 Rafinesque's big-eared bats each. One abandoned house owned by the Conservation Club, a private land holding in Clay County, was surveyed in May and June 2004. Sixty-two individuals were observed in May 2004 making this the largest known maternal colony for this species in Mississippi. Ten cisterns in Adams County were surveyed from February 2003- January 2006. Rafinesque's big-eared bats were not observed in these cisterns during the survey period, however 3 cisterns contained large colonies of southeastern myotis. Using infrared cameras, bats were recorded emerging from occupied cisterns at sunset to determine abundance. In August 2004, 5,479 individuals were recorded emerging from a cistern at Laurel Hill Plantation and 6,486 were recorded emerging from a cistern at Hollywood Plantation. A second cistern at Hollywood Plantation contained 5,681 in May 2004. These are the largest known maternal colonies for southeastern myotis in Mississippi. One culvert on Laurel Hill Plantation, a private holding adjacent to St. Catherine Creek NWR, was surveyed for bat occupancy 6 times from February 2003- January 2005. One Rafinesque's big-eared bat was observed several times and 5 southeastern myotis were observed in January 2005. Seven culverts on Meridian Naval Air Station, Lauderdale County, were surveyed for bat occupancy in May 2002 and monthly from March 2005-November 2006. Five Rafinesque's big-eared bats were observed in May 2002, but have not been observed since. All the culverts were commonly used by SE myotis, 1 of which was a confirmed maternal colony. Twenty-two caves were surveyed in 11 counties from October 2005- February 2007.

This particular refuge lies in the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona and is centered on the bottomlands of the Altar Valley. It is a landscape unique in many ways, but one very specific way is that its southern boundary is the border between Mexico and the United States: this border is arbitrary not only in terms of topography and vegetation, but also in terms of human history. It is only recently, within the last one hundred or so years, that the International Border has divided the people who live on its south side, with the people who live on its north side. That is to say, for most of human history, people have crossed this imaginary line seamlessly as they went about their lives creating meaning for themselves and for their families.

The main objective of the survey was to assess the current status of businesses in Lesotho, in relation to four principal factors, namely, water supply and sanitation, essential health services, investment climate in the country, land administration and modernization of the commercial legal system. The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%). In contrast, most jointly-owned enterprises had acquired plots through transfer from someone for cash (32.6%), followed by public sector agency grants (26.3%).  A significant proportion (69.8%) of enterprises did not have formally registered titles/documents to the premises that they used; The top reason for opting to rent/sublease business premises was not intending to acquire land, which was mentioned by 35.1 percent of enterprises. The second reason was of enterprises that did not qualify to hold land in Lesotho, which was mentioned by 23.2 percent of enterprises Majority (67.2 percent) of enterprises did not have occupational insurance. Over 50 percent of the enterprises did not have all the policies. Workers in 83.5 percent of all enterprises did not have access to a health and safety officer.  In 88.3 and 91.7 percent of all enterprises, workers did not have access to a counselor and services of a Social Worker, respectively.

A full scale field test conducted in Fairbanks, Alaska, confirmed the laboratory findings, but discovered that naturally bonded ice aggregate disaggregated easily under tractive forces. It was found that the addition of a small quantity of water to the surface increased the surface bonding sufficiently to resist normal transportation and construction equipment traffic. Subsequent laboratory investigation has determined that the quantity of water required is of such magnitude that below ambient temperatures of 15 deg F (-31 deg. C), the sensible heat of the aggregate contained within the bond layer, is sufficient to freeze the added water The consequence of this finding is that full utilization of an ice aggregate structure is possible within minutes of placement. The Fairbanks field test found that successful ice aggregate roads can be constructed to thicknesses of at least three feet in single lift by dumping, grading,and the application of bond water. Damage to fragile ecosystems may be greatly reduced by using the single pass, thick section ice aggregate construction technique."

A high degree of overlap in food, home range, and den site requirements suggests that if neutered red fox are introduced onto islands supporting arctic fox populations, they will effectively outcompete the arctic fox for access to these resources. Red foxes are apparently behaviorally dominant in areas of sympatry and are able to displace arctic foxes from preferred feeding and den sites. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in resource availability on islands with diverse topography, however, may permit coexistence of the two species. Additional field research is recommended to determine if red fox can completely exclude the arctic fox if introductions are made in sufficient numbers."

The Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge's (NWR) Barnegat eyrie failed to produce a single fledgling during this period, despite consistent nesting attempts. Poor reproductive performance at the Barnegat eyrie prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife to investigate potential interaction between contaminants and peregrine falcon reproductive performance. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that TCDD equivalent concentrations (TEQs) of planar PCB congeners, PCDDs, and PCDFs are higher in eggs from eyries exhibiting low productivity. In addition, other organochlorines and inorganic contaminants were examined as potential contributors to reproductive risks. Non-viable eggs from the Edwin B. Forsythe NWR and seven other New Jersey eyries were analyzed for planar PCB congeners, PCDDs, PCDFs, inorganics, and organochlorine pesticides. Reproductive data were summarized to evaluate the relationship between the levels of contaminants in peregrine falcon eggs and productivity. Non-ortho PCBs (specifically PCB 77 and PCB 126) were present at elevated levels in Atlantic coast eggs relative to those of the Delaware River. Based on TEQs, non-ortho PCBs (PCB 77 and PCB 126) were the most likely contributors to observed hatching failure on the Atlantic coast. Based on a raptor-specific reference toxicity value, levels of PCB 126 alone were sufficient to impact hatching success in all Atlantic coast nests, but not Delaware River nests. Total TEQ concentrations on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey were among the highest ever documented in eggs of this species (318 to 757 pg/g fresh weight). These findings contrast with those of the Delaware River eyries where total TEQ concentrations (90 to 175 pg/g) were generally below levels of concern. It is evident that the congener profiles in the Atlantic coast eggs were substantially different from those of the Delaware River. Concentrations of mercury and DDE were also detected in some eggs at levels which may adversely affect peregrine falcon reproductive success. The mean mercury concentration at Atlantic coast eyries (0.38 ug/g fresh weight) was more than 30 times greater than that at Delaware River eyries (0.012 ug/g). The DDE concentration at some eyries indicated that DDE may continue to be a reproductive hazard for some of these birds (maximum of 24.2 ug/g at the Tuckahoe nest). While detected concentrations of PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, DDE, and mercury in many eggs were theoretically sufficient to impact peregrine falcon reproduction, the productivity and eggshell thinning data do not support a conclusion of reproductive impairment in New Jersey peregrine falcons due to contaminants. Multiple regression analysis revealed no correlation between concentrations of DDE, PCB 77, PCB 126, total PCBs, and total TEQs in eggs and eggshell thickness data from the same eggs. If contaminants are impacting reproduction, the effect is minor when compared to influences such as nest locations (bridge vs. tower), disturbance, predation, etc., and would probably be undetectable at the sample sizes involved in this study. Further congener-specific organochlorine and inorganic monitoring of peregrines, their prey and supporting food chain is recommended to identify exposure pathways and elucidate reasons for the large differences in exposure between Atlantic coast and Delaware River eyries."

Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

The Institutional Strengthening Subactivity (ISSA) provided general technical support to water user associations (WUAs), the regional organizations that manage the distribution of and payment for irrigation water in Armenia. ISSA also provided assistance to three Water Supply Agencies (WSAs) that operate and maintain irrigation dams and pumping stations. The general aim of ISSA was to strengthen WUAs' and WSAs' managerial, technical, structural, and financial capacity and self-sufficiency. The intent of these improvements was to create more efficient and consistent irrigation supply for WUA members. ISSA also included an irrigation policy reform component, in which a reform strategy was developed through a participatory process with stakeholders such as WUA and government officials.   The WtM impact evaluation originally focused on WtM training, using a random assignment design to evaluate this WtM component. Initially, evaluations of the other three WtM components were not planned. However, MCC subsequently decided to conduct analyses of the effects of the other components to the extent possible using existing quantitative data sources. Although the analyses of WtM credit, ISSA, and PPM have important limitations, these additional analyses can still help document these components' implementation and provide suggestive evidence of whether they generated their intended effects. For each of the four components of the WtM Activity, we examine the following two broad sets of questions:          How was the component implemented? What were the characteristics of each component's participants, and how were these participants identified and recruited? What assistance was provided to participants through the component?          What were the impacts of the component? What were the impacts on practices or use of new technologies as a result of the component? What were the impacts on key outcomes such as household income and poverty?     We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to answer these research questions.  ISSA Evaluation Approach    For the ISSA evaluation, two data sources were used: (1) the Water User Association Administrative Survey and (2) the Water User Survey to compare WUA and water-user outcomes before ISSA to analogous outcomes after ISSA. This before-after design does not allow us to isolate the effect of ISSA from other factors that could have influenced WUAs' and water users' outcomes over this same time period, but it was the only viable option given the absence of a comparison group for the 44 WUAs assisted under the project."

The study was conducted on four salt evaporation ponds in San Mateo County, from June 1978 through June 1979. Salinity readings were taken from each pond, and the total number of birds per pond was counted. The salinities ranged from a low of 50 parts/1,000 in Pond I to a high of 270 parts/1,000 in Pond IV. Thirty-six species were identified and a total of 49,857 birds were counted. Shorebirds, waterfowl, and gulls were the most common species using the salt ponds.  The surface-feeding ducks and the phalaropes exhibited a preference for Pond I which had the lowest average salinity reading of the four ponds studies. The shorebirds, diving ducks, and gulls all showed a high degree of salinity tolerance and were found on all ponds. The shorebirds made the heaviest use of ponds which were sufficiently shallow for wading regardless of salinities, thus showing a possible food foraging preference."

Following native prairie restoration within designated zones, managing the density of prairie dogs of 6-10 animals/acre is desired to prevent overutilization of vegetation, ensuring the critical long-term sustainability of native vegetation. However, a sufficient density of animals should also be maintained to ensure that adequate habitat and sufficient prey base is available for resources of concern. The purpose of the black-tailed prairie dog inventory is to determine if the management goals and objective of 6-10 animals/acre are being met according to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Management Plan and Habitat Management Plan. The results of the survey will also be used to determine if the population densities of black-tailed prairie dogs are suitable for the reintroduction of black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) within the established 2,585 acres of prairie dog management zones. Survey methods and data analysis were based on established protocol (Biggins et al 1993). In addition, RMANWR staff and the Denver Zoo piloted and tested an alternative to Biggins et al. 1993; by conducting a hundred percent inventory of active and inactive prairie dog burrows within the management zones (Eads et al 2011). The total prairie dog population of all management zones averaged 19.16 PD/ac. Established prairie dog management zones exceed the habitat requirements for black-footed ferrets, and therefore provide suitable prairie dog populations for approximately 41 female black-footed-ferret families [an adult female, her 3.3 (average) young, and 0.5 males]."

We used scat deposition rates to evaluate relative abundance, distance sampling to estimate density, and scat analysis to evaluate food habits in two major habitat types: woodland-prairie in the south and prairie in the north. There was wide variation in relative abundance (scats/mile/day) per season and survey period. Abundance ranged from 0.44 in early March to a low of 0.01 in August. The southern area had 3 times more scat deposition compared to the northern area which was likely associated with differences in habitat and prey availability. The estimated population size during August was 19 coyotes (95% C.I. = 12-29) with a density of0.29 / krn2 (95% C.I. = 0.18-0.44). Coyote density had decreased by more than half compared with an estimate obtained in 1992. Food supplies have been noted as the predominant restraint on coyote populations, and fluctuating prey populations may be responsible. A diverse diet is apparent in many coyote populations, including our study. Over the entire study period, small mammals were an important part of coyote diet (60%) while deer were 12%, mid-sized rodents 10%, rabbits 9%. Birds, reptiles, insects, and plants constituted only a small percent of the diet. This trend was evident during late-winter and spring though the diet was more diverse in summer and early fall. Deer constituted the majority of the diet during summer as coyotes exploited abundant young fawns. The percent of deer in scats was higher in the southern area where deer used tree groves for cover during fawning. While the causes of fawn mortality are varied, high predation of fawns by coyotes at our study site was well documented in 2005 and field data suggest that this may be a contributing factor to low recruitment. However, a lack of sufficient cover may predispose fawns to greater predation through increased susceptibility."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

What was the distribution of those impacts? Were the above impacts distributed differently across key population sub-groups, namely gender, age, or income groups?   How did impacts vary according to the exposure period?   What factors - contextual, household-specific, targeting or business models, other - drive or constrain adoption of new connections, appliances, and energy services related to off-grid energy?   Via what mechanisms did revenue generation or productivity increase? (i.e., for what types of activities/businesses did energy stimulate investment and growth?)   Can the OCEF-supported investments be considered cost-beneficial or cost-effective, relative to alternatives?    Exposure to treatment  The impact evaluation samples households or businesses randomly from the lists of only those customers signing up for new connections from the grantees, and collect baseline and follow-up data from these individuals. Such lists will need to be obtained promptly from grantees once new customers are identified, and surveys will need to be deployed rapidly to collect baseline data, prior to connections being installed (baseline surveying will need to occur on a rolling basis).   Control zones will be oversampled at baseline, to allow ex post matching from a representative sample of households or businesses in control communes to those actually signing up to receive connections in treatment zones. This approach requires a larger sample of controls at baseline but would allow a full panel analysis of households and businesses for the matched sample of observations. Importantly, treatment is defined at the household or business level in this approach for Windows 2 and 3, and probably at the community level (given that the investments there are for public services) for Window 1. (The appropriate level of assignment for Window 4 is currently unclear.)"

These five phases differ slightly from the six main steps identified in the IGP grant manual; however, all of the activities reflected in the grant cycle implementation figure (p. 19 of the grants manual) are included in the five phases below. We chose to establish slightly different grant cycle implementation phases so the performance evaluation can address a critical element not reflected in the IGP manual's phases: \u201crevising the process.\u201d This phase is a critical component of the performance evaluation of the IGP facility.    AIR's performance evaluation of the IGP is structured around the five phases of IGP implementation mentioned above. AIR will use the following overarching questions as a framework to the evaluation question design:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   Did the IGP adhere to its objectives:    1.  To increase and sustain the access of the poor to quality water and sanitation and improved drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    2.  To enhance the functioning of the water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems?    3.  To demonstrate an innovative approach or technology to improve water use, sanitation, and hygiene practices among the poor?    4.  To identify and provide assistance to innovative partnership arrangements, particularly through private sector engagement?    5.  To provide significant access by women and vulnerable groups to the IGP and its benefits?    6.  To expand opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generating activities related to water supply, sanitation, and drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    \u00b7   Did the grant selection process prioritize interventions based on its key objectives, and was process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects?    \u00b7   Is grant oversight sufficient?  Is it cost-effective?    \u00b7   How can the Innovation Grant Program better mobilize private-sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCC specifically or another organization best replicate this program?    Start-up: During start- up, we will investigate the effectiveness of the IGP solicitation process to potential grantees. Another key area of interest will be gathering the demographic information of the grantees. The evaluation of the IGP's start-up phase will be based on the questions below:    \u00b7   What is the implementation plan for the grants?    \u00b7   How is information about the program disseminated?     \u00b7   Have there been specific outreach and dissemination activities targeting potential grantees that are best qualified to provide high quality services to women's groups, poor communities, and new entrepreneurs?    \u00b7   Does the MCA provide assistance with grant development, funding guidelines, and budgeting?     \u00b7   Does MCA facilitate connections between (potential) applicants or between applicants and government agencies?    \u00b7   Do targeted communities and stakeholders understand the intention and structure of the grant program?     \u00b7   What is the proportion of grantees from each technical intervention area (i.e. solid waste removal)?     \u00b7   What are potential grantees' and their communities' expectations of the program?     \u00b7   How well informed are potential grantees of the application and selection process, and of the available resources and support to help them participate?    \u00b7   How many grantees apply and how many applications do grantees submit?    \u00b7   How many applications meet the basic qualifications for participation in the program?     \u00b7   Do the interventions supported by the IGP clearly benefit poor communities, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs?     \u00b7   To what extent do the number and nature of applications meet MCA expectations?     \u00b7   To what extent do the applications cover a broad range of services and service areas?    \u00b7   Are proposals received highly relevant to the proposal call area and well distributed across the different calls areas?     \u00b7   Do the problem statements and proposal calls address areas that key IGP stakeholders perceive to be high impact?    Selection: During selection, we will investigate the selection process of the IGP with particular focus on the scoring procedures of the grants. Additionally, AIR will also examine the ways in which selection decisions are communicated to the grantees. Selection questions include:    \u00b7   Does IGPM follow its rules for reviewing, rating, and ranking grant applications?     \u00b7   Are the reviewers adequately trained and supported?     \u00b7   Is the review process fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of potential grantees?    \u00b7   Are grantees notified of the grant decision in a timely and effective way?    \u00b7   Are grantees provided with feedback that enables them to improve their grant application and resubmit?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants understand and accept the outcome of the selection process?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants plan to resubmit revised applications?     \u00b7   Are rejected applicants requesting assistance with resubmission?     \u00b7   How many grants are awarded?     \u00b7   What is the average grant size?     \u00b7   What proportion of available funds is committed to accepted grants?     \u00b7   Is the grant selection process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects based on how the projects align with IGP investment criteria?     Implementing the award: During the implementation phase, we will investigate the process of implementing the award. AIR will closely examine the negotiations of grantees' contracts, the process in which funds are disbursed, and the ability of grantees to successfully meet their quarterly goals. Illustrative research questions include:    \u00b7   How did the negotiations of the contract impact the implementation of the award?     \u00b7   Are grantees adequately supported with necessary technical and managerial assistance?    \u00b7   Are funds transmitted to grantees in a timely and efficient way?     \u00b7   Are grantee spending and performance adequately and efficiently monitored?    \u00b7   Do grantees receive timely feedback on their performance?     \u00b7   How does MCA monitor its own performance in the operation of the grant program?    \u00b7   Is MCA meeting its own expectations for successful implementation of the grant program?     \u00b7   How well is the grant program integrated into other compact activities?    \u00b7   What proportion of awarded grant funds is spent on time and on target?     \u00b7   What proportion of grantees achieves their performance objectives at various points throughout the grant period?    \u00b7   Is MCA's oversight of the grants sufficient and cost effective in terms of spending and M&E targets? \u00b7   Does MCA-Zambia/IGPM verify that applicants have met quarterly milestones before awarding the conditional grant disbursements?     \u00b7   What percentages of applicants fail to receive disbursements on time due to failure to meet quarterly milestones?    Completing the award: During the completion phase of the award, we will investigate the sustainability and impact of the grantees' programs. In particular, how effective IGP efforts were in increasing access to clean water and sanitation to vulnerable communities. AIR will pay particular attention to grantees' ability to successfully sustain its programs efforts and the impacts of these programs on their catchment communities. As part of these efforts, AIR will examine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders regarding grantees' programs. However, it is important to note that a full assessment of IGP may not be possible due to the short timeframe.  Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   What proportion of grantees is still active in business at the end of the grant period?    \u00b7   What proportions of the grants demonstrate potentially viable, long-term, profit-generating business opportunities?     \u00b7   How do civil society organizations and policy makers perceive the changes the program has made to the overall infrastructure for water, sanitation, and drainage services in Lusaka?    \u00b7   How aware of the program are households, civil society organizations, policy makers, and other water and sanitation focused stakeholders?     \u00b7   Has the grantee spurred \u201ccopycat\u201d organizations?    \u00b7   Did the grantees feel that they received adequate time to thoroughly complete all of the interventions?    \u00b7    To what extent are the benefits of the program cited as reasons for larger systemic changes by policy makers and compact implementing entities?     \u00b7   What is policy makers and compact implementing entities' perception of the extent to which the program has created individual interventions and structures that are sustainable even after program funding ends?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new partnerships between organizations in water, sanitation, or solid waste value chain?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new private sector investment in the sector?    \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new/ refined models of pro-poor service delivery?     \u00b7   What is the perception of benefits to the poor and vulnerable populations?     Revising the process: During this phase, AIR will investigate IGP's ability to successfully meet its objectives. As part of this process, AIR will examine the ways in that the IGP process could be further improved. Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   How can the IGP better mobilize private sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCA specifically or another organization best replicate this program?"

Using the USGS HEM Event Management tool, the start and end point of fish species are identified on named and un-named rivers and streams in the park. The HEM tool uses linear referencing to create linear feature class data which depicts the extent of fish distribution within the stream network. The EVENTTYPE attributes lists the fish species and can be used in combination with attribute queries to create one or many species distribution maps. These data support an on-going project and are published online to support project operational needs. As such, these data are not considered valid or final and may contain omissions or errors. Background and HistoryThe brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only trout native to the southern Appalachian Mountains. It was once widespread in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), occupying small, swift, high elevation mountain streams as well as larger rivers down to elevations of 1,600 feet. Since 1900, the brook trout has vanished from about 75% of its historical range in GRSM. The initial loss was due to large-scale mechanized logging operations early in the 20th century. Clear cuts and subsequent fires on steep mountainsides led to soil run-off and stream siltation. In addition, trees were cut from stream banks, allowing more sunlight to reach the waterways and raising water temperatures. The brook trout is even less tolerant of warm water than other trout species- it can not survive temperatures above 68\u02daF. (20\u02daC).As a result of these environmental changes, the brook trout disappeared from all streams in the Smokies below elevations of 3,000 feet. The decline of the brook trout caused displeasure among anglers who longed to trout fish in the mountains. In response, around 1910, logging companies and other entities began stocking streams with non-native rainbow trout from the western United States, brown trout from Europe, and brook trout from the northern United States. Stocking of northern brook trout continued into the 1950s; rainbow trout stocking did not cease until 1975. Competition from the non-native trout, especially rainbows, lead to further declines in the brook trout population. Rainbow trout are larger, more aggressive fish which dominate the prime habitats in streams and eat small brook trout. Biologists believe brook trout range in the Smokies has declined dramatically due to rainbow competition. Most surviving brook trout have become confined to marginal streams above 3,500 feet in elevation.Stream acidification is an increasingly serious threat to the survival of brook trout. Streams in GRSM naturally become more acidic at higher elevations. However, research shows that areas in the park above 4,800 feet in elevation are receiving some of the highest amounts of acid rain, acid fog, and dry deposition of any monitored site in North America. Consequently, many high elevation streams are becoming increasingly acidic, some to the point that they can no longer support brook trout.In 1996, genetic research conducted by the University of Tennessee confirmed long-held beliefs that the southern Appalachian brook trout is a distinct subspecies, differing in several ways from the stocked fish native to the northeastern United States and Canada. Only about 15% of park streams are believed to harbor pure strains of truly native fish, undiluted by hybridization with northern brook trout. Since the southern subspecies has such a limited range, and because that range has been diminished drastically in the last 100 years, the southern brook trout is considered a species of special concern. The Park Service is especially watchful of acidification and competition from rainbow trout in streams where the subspecies currently survives. Why Monitor Distribution?It has been determined that native brook trout have lost approximately 75% of their range and that 30 s"

                "text": "Great Smoky Mountains National Park Amphitheaters THESE POINTS of open air assembly and seating in parks range from the minor, represented by the campfire circle, sometimes termed a lecture circle or council ring, to the large and elaborate in the form of outdoor theater or amphitheater. The elementary expressions are to be found in many parks, while the more extensive developments are apt to occur in large parks appealing to more than local interest, or in metropolitan parks where local or civic interest is well defined. The locating of the intimate circle or ring is largely a matter of proximity to use-demand, as represented by a cabin or camp group, or other such point of concentration within the park. A small plot preferably generally level, but failing that, not too rugged or precipitous, is the only topographic requirement. The larger amphitheater, in its several varying manifestations, should on the other hand be located in a natural bowl wherever possible. Unless existing contours truly invite such development, a remoulding of them to create a natural effect is apt to require an amount of work disproportionate to the gain. If anything short of accomplishment of complete naturalness results from a remoulding of topography in creation of an amphitheater, the park area is burdened with a disfiguring scar that should be rigidly avoided.The minor campfire circle or ring is merely the provision of seating around the community campfire, where the evening hours may be passed with song and story in the warmth of good comradeship and the friendly fire. The campfire is the sole physical essential of this foregathering place in the open. It is often given a fixity of location by the building of seats around it, particularly if conditions of climate or insect life make sitting on the ground unadvisable. Such seating may be merely logs or some more sophisticated adaptation of them, or again may be boulders or masonry construction, where stone is the more abundant native material. But there are no fixed principles, no traditions to be pressed, beyond admonishing an attention to the claims of the immediate natural environment.The principles applicable to the creation of amphitheaters or outdoor theaters are numerous. Probably paramount are the considerations of sight lines and acoustics, here quite as important as for the enclosed auditorium. Many will at first thought regard acoustics as not of the problem, but these should not fail to appreciate that hills and mountains, water surfaces, woods and forests, deflect and echo sound in accordance with their own laws, no less than do man-made surroundings, and call for just as much study and advance consideration.It is important that the stage be to the east or north, so that the audience will not face the afternoon sun. A distant view as background for the stage platform is greatly to be desired, or better still a picturesque cliff as at Pine Mountain, in Kentucky. If these do not exist, a background of trees should be sought. The amphitheater should be encircled by trees, to screen it from view and provide all possible shade for the audience, and to act as barrier against the disturbing noises of other park activities.The outdoor stage is often merely a platform, the distant view or a near-by stand of trees serving as a backdrop. If these are lacking, or some required use of the stage demands it, an artificial background of rustic construction, or of planting, or a combination of the two is created. When the showing of motion pictures is an activity, the extent of the structural background will be dictated by the size of the picture screen. The screen should be removable in winter, should be recessed for some measure of protection, and supplemented with dark canvas curtains to be drawn over it when pictures are not being shown. Where dramatic entertainment is to be offered, some provision of dressing room space is necessary. The stage of the amphitheater, being the focal point, must be outstandingly representative of park character. No"

Television, newspapers and magazines bombard us with these challenging and alarming words. We hear how we have to diversify our economy. We hear that we must find new specialized niches for Alaskan businesses. We hear how we must change to meet today's challenges with tomorrow's skills. Within the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station and the School of Agriculture and Land Resources Management, we've listened to these prophecies. Only we heard them and started addressing them more than a decade ago. We listened when they were only whispers. We did so that we could respond when the whispers became issues needing answers. Just look at the diversity of articles in this issue of Agroborealis and see how we've responded over the years. And then take a few minutes and review the list of publications in the back. Notice the diversity of topics explored. See how so many of them answer some of the questions we ask today. Significantly, many of these publications report studies initiated three, five or more years ago. Reporting findings from our studies continues to be one of the most important responsibilities of our researchers. But research takes time. That's why today, we're still listening to whispers. And from those whispers, we plan our research programs to have answers in 1996 or 1997 or even 2006. With our talented staff and faculty, we'll continue to explore Alaska's many diverse opportunities and problems in natural resources management, agriculture and forestry. This issue of Agroborealis illustrates research in projects ranging from reindeer to arctic tundra rehabilitation. In closing I'd like to thank both ARCO Alaska, Inc. and BP Exploration (Alaska) for their generous grants to underwrite the costs of color photography in Arctic Tundra Rehabilitation-Observations of Progress and Benefits to Alaska. The article, begins on page 29. This summer, the companies will be giving reprints of the article to Prudhoe Bay visitors. Incidentally, Dr. McKendrick started his work on the North Slope in 1972. We'd also like you to know that this issue of Agroborealis is printed on recycled paper. That's another of our responses to the world's changes."

Road data are used for many purposes including planning and management, mapping and condition assessment, routing and navigation, public information, emergency response, and research. A current, accurate representation of park roads is needed for national reporting and a variety of mapping requirements at all levels of the National Park Service and the general public. A National-level dataset allows the NPS to communicate a consistent and high-quality roads database to NPS staff, partners, visitors, and entities that produce maps and location-based services of park units. The collection, storage, and management of road-related data are important components of everyday business activities in many Federal and State land-managing agencies, road organizations, and businesses. From a management perspective, road data must often mesh closely with other types of infrastructure, resource, and facility enterprise data. For the public using paper maps, the internet, GPS or other instrumentation, standard data formats enable users to consistently and predictably identify specific trails and a core set of corresponding information. Today, digital road data are a necessity throughout a road data management life-cycle, from road planning through design, construction, operation, and maintenance. Automating, sharing, and leveraging road data through this widely accepted standard can provide a variety of important benefits: Efficiency \u2013 creating and gathering road data that are standardized and readily usable. Compatibility \u2013 compiling data from one project or discipline that can be compatible with other applications; Consistency \u2013 using the same standards, meshing data produced by one organization with that developed by another; Speed \u2013 hastening the availability of data through a reduction in duplicative efforts and lowered production costs (Applications can be developed more quickly and with more interoperability by using existing standards-compliant data); Conflict resolution \u2013 resolving conflicting road data more easily if compliant to the same standards; Reliability \u2013 improving the quality of shared road data by increasing the number of individuals who find and correct errors; and Reusability \u2013 allow maximum reuse across agencies and support objectives of EGovernment (E-Gov) initiatives and enterprise architecture."

                "text": "Inventory of online public databases and repositories holding agricultural data in 2017 United States agricultural researchers have many options for making their data available online. This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.    Purpose    As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.    An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the Ag Data Commons, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to  establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals    compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms    determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data    ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data  Approach    The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.    Search methods    We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of \u201cagricultural data\u201d /\u201cag data\u201d / \u201cscientific data\u201d + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.    We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of \u201cagriculture\u201d, \u201cag data\u201d and \u201cuniversity\u201d to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University \u2013 International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis \u2013 Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.    Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.    Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.    Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.    Evaluation    We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.    We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.    Results    A summary of the major findings from our data review:  Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.    There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.    Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation."

To increase and sustain the access of the poor to quality water and sanitation and improved drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    2.  To enhance the functioning of the water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems?    3.  To demonstrate an innovative approach or technology to improve water use, sanitation, and hygiene practices among the poor?    4.  To identify and provide assistance to innovative partnership arrangements, particularly through private sector engagement?    5.  To provide significant access by women and vulnerable groups to the IGP and its benefits?    6.  To expand opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generating activities related to water supply, sanitation, and drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    \u00b7   Did the grant selection process prioritize interventions based on its key objectives, and was process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects?    \u00b7   Is grant oversight sufficient?  Is it cost-effective?    \u00b7   How can the Innovation Grant Program better mobilize private-sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCC specifically or another organization best replicate this program?    Start-up: During start- up, we will investigate the effectiveness of the IGP solicitation process to potential grantees. Another key area of interest will be gathering the demographic information of the grantees. The evaluation of the IGP's start-up phase will be based on the questions below:    \u00b7   What is the implementation plan for the grants?    \u00b7   How is information about the program disseminated?     \u00b7   Have there been specific outreach and dissemination activities targeting potential grantees that are best qualified to provide high quality services to women's groups, poor communities, and new entrepreneurs?    \u00b7   Does the MCA provide assistance with grant development, funding guidelines, and budgeting?     \u00b7   Does MCA facilitate connections between (potential) applicants or between applicants and government agencies?    \u00b7   Do targeted communities and stakeholders understand the intention and structure of the grant program?     \u00b7   What is the proportion of grantees from each technical intervention area (i.e. solid waste removal)?     \u00b7   What are potential grantees' and their communities' expectations of the program?     \u00b7   How well informed are potential grantees of the application and selection process, and of the available resources and support to help them participate?    \u00b7   How many grantees apply and how many applications do grantees submit?    \u00b7   How many applications meet the basic qualifications for participation in the program?     \u00b7   Do the interventions supported by the IGP clearly benefit poor communities, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs?     \u00b7   To what extent do the number and nature of applications meet MCA expectations?     \u00b7   To what extent do the applications cover a broad range of services and service areas?    \u00b7   Are proposals received highly relevant to the proposal call area and well distributed across the different calls areas?     \u00b7   Do the problem statements and proposal calls address areas that key IGP stakeholders perceive to be high impact?    Selection: During selection, we will investigate the selection process of the IGP with particular focus on the scoring procedures of the grants. Additionally, AIR will also examine the ways in which selection decisions are communicated to the grantees. Selection questions include:    \u00b7   Does IGPM follow its rules for reviewing, rating, and ranking grant applications?     \u00b7   Are the reviewers adequately trained and supported?     \u00b7   Is the review process fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of potential grantees?    \u00b7   Are grantees notified of the grant decision in a timely and effective way?    \u00b7   Are grantees provided with feedback that enables them to improve their grant application and resubmit?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants understand and accept the outcome of the selection process?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants plan to resubmit revised applications?     \u00b7   Are rejected applicants requesting assistance with resubmission?     \u00b7   How many grants are awarded?     \u00b7   What is the average grant size?     \u00b7   What proportion of available funds is committed to accepted grants?     \u00b7   Is the grant selection process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects based on how the projects align with IGP investment criteria?     Implementing the award: During the implementation phase, we will investigate the process of implementing the award. AIR will closely examine the negotiations of grantees' contracts, the process in which funds are disbursed, and the ability of grantees to successfully meet their quarterly goals. Illustrative research questions include:    \u00b7   How did the negotiations of the contract impact the implementation of the award?     \u00b7   Are grantees adequately supported with necessary technical and managerial assistance?    \u00b7   Are funds transmitted to grantees in a timely and efficient way?     \u00b7   Are grantee spending and performance adequately and efficiently monitored?    \u00b7   Do grantees receive timely feedback on their performance?     \u00b7   How does MCA monitor its own performance in the operation of the grant program?    \u00b7   Is MCA meeting its own expectations for successful implementation of the grant program?     \u00b7   How well is the grant program integrated into other compact activities?    \u00b7   What proportion of awarded grant funds is spent on time and on target?     \u00b7   What proportion of grantees achieves their performance objectives at various points throughout the grant period?    \u00b7   Is MCA's oversight of the grants sufficient and cost effective in terms of spending and M&E targets? \u00b7   Does MCA-Zambia/IGPM verify that applicants have met quarterly milestones before awarding the conditional grant disbursements?     \u00b7   What percentages of applicants fail to receive disbursements on time due to failure to meet quarterly milestones?    Completing the award: During the completion phase of the award, we will investigate the sustainability and impact of the grantees' programs. In particular, how effective IGP efforts were in increasing access to clean water and sanitation to vulnerable communities. AIR will pay particular attention to grantees' ability to successfully sustain its programs efforts and the impacts of these programs on their catchment communities. As part of these efforts, AIR will examine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders regarding grantees' programs. However, it is important to note that a full assessment of IGP may not be possible due to the short timeframe.  Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   What proportion of grantees is still active in business at the end of the grant period?    \u00b7   What proportions of the grants demonstrate potentially viable, long-term, profit-generating business opportunities?     \u00b7   How do civil society organizations and policy makers perceive the changes the program has made to the overall infrastructure for water, sanitation, and drainage services in Lusaka?    \u00b7   How aware of the program are households, civil society organizations, policy makers, and other water and sanitation focused stakeholders?     \u00b7   Has the grantee spurred \u201ccopycat\u201d organizations?    \u00b7   Did the grantees feel that they received adequate time to thoroughly complete all of the interventions?    \u00b7    To what extent are the benefits of the program cited as reasons for larger systemic changes by policy makers and compact implementing entities?     \u00b7   What is policy makers and compact implementing entities' perception of the extent to which the program has created individual interventions and structures that are sustainable even after program funding ends?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new partnerships between organizations in water, sanitation, or solid waste value chain?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new private sector investment in the sector?    \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new/ refined models of pro-poor service delivery?     \u00b7   What is the perception of benefits to the poor and vulnerable populations?     Revising the process: During this phase, AIR will investigate IGP's ability to successfully meet its objectives. As part of this process, AIR will examine the ways in that the IGP process could be further improved. Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   How can the IGP better mobilize private sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCA specifically or another organization best replicate this program?"

Northern pintails are a target species of the North American Waterfowl management Plan (NAWMP) and were designated as a science priority for 2011 by the Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative. The RWB is believed to provide habitat for 30% of the continental pintail population during spring migration (Gersib et al. 1992). Additionally, the RWB Joint Venture\u2019s implementation plan estimates 50% of the midcontinent mallard population use RWB wetlands during the spring. We currently do not know how many greenwinged teal use the RWB wetlands but they are abundant, pass through the RWB later than the other two species, and they are the most harvested species in North America (NAWMP). Understanding food habits by these species will help regional and national conservation efforts by providing data that will be incorporated in a bioenergetic assessment for monitoring the RWB WMD\u2019s. This will help meet objectives set by the RWBJV (Newton 2006, Drahota et al. 2008, Callicutt et al. 2011, Petrie et al. 2011).  This proposal seeks 1) To evaluate food use of selected Anatidae that currently utilize the RWB as a mid\u2010latitude refueling stopover and establish baseline data about dietary patterns. 2) To estimate carrying capacity of RWB habitats based on food use and wetland\u2010derived forage availability (Drahota unpublished data). 3) To evaluate depletion rates caused by large populations of Anatidae in comparison to what is available and evaluate current management practices that may influence forage availability for concurring species use. 4) Evaluate the forage composition to determine how much each species rely on waste grain versus wetland derived resources and evaluate body condition as a dependent variable in diet selection. 5) Determine baseline body condition of three common species of waterfowl during peak migration use."

We integrated concepts from decision analysis, political and institutional analysis, and public choice economics into a single, comprehensive approach called Disparate Stakeholder Management (DSM). The objective of developing the DSM approach is to help decision makers better describe, measure, communicate, and resolve management issues with disparate stakeholders. We demonstrate the DSM approach on elk and bison management and show how knowing about stakeholder preferences can increase satisfaction overall for stakeholders, even when they hold very different view."

Sites are sampled on a rotational basis occurring once every two years. Currently (2018), there are seven watersheds being sampled using IBI protocols. Depending on the year, these watersheds include Noland and Deep creeks, Big Creek, the East Prong of Little River, Straight Fork, and Hazel Creek. In 2018, five sites were surveyed: East Prong Little River at Elkmont, Cataloochee Creek, Big Creek, Middle Prong of the Little Pigeon River, and Deep Creek. Fish community assessments are made after collecting specimens using backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining techniques. Unlike the 3-Pass depletion method used to observe census data from GRSM streams, an IBI is used to determine how many species of fish are represented in a stream segment by surveying the various types of habitat: riffles, runs, pools, and shoreline. Techniques for IBI sampling also use seining in conjunction with electrofishing for fish capture. The point of IBI sampling isn\u2019t to remove all the fish present, but rather to determine the community assemblage, i.e., species diversity within the stream segment. The GRSM Fishery Division works in conjunction with aquatics biologists at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), who then provide \u201cscores\u201d regarding the species\u2019 representation or robustness given the site criteria.  IBI scores and metrics are determined using the TVA IBI Stream Survey Recording System v2.02. Once data have been entered by GRSM staff in the TVA Stream Survey database, results are sent to TVA biologists, who then provide GRSM with the scores associated with the species observed."

Using the first solar domain-specific benchmark data set that contains multiple types of phenomena, we investigated combination of different image parameters with different dissimilarity measure sin order to determine which combination will allow us to differentiate our solar data within each class and versus the rest of the classes. In this work we also address the issue of reducing dimensionality by applying multidimensional scaling to our dissimilarity matrices produced by the previously mentioned combination.  By applying multidimensional scaling we can investigate how many resulting components are needed in order to maintain a good representation of our data (in an artificial dimensional space) and how many can be discarded in order to economize our storage costs.  We present a comparative analysis between different classifiers in order to determine the amount of dimensionality reduction that can be achieved with said combination of image parameters, similarity measure and multidimensional scaling."

                "text": "Indonesia - Green Prosperity: Community-Based Off-Grid Renewable Energy Grant Portfolio Taken as a whole, this evaluation aims, to the extent possible, to validate the program logic underlying the portfolio of community-based off-grid renewable energy grants in the Green Prosperity Grant Facility, doing so through a focused investigation of two specific grants: W3A Akuo Energy Solar/Micro-Hydro, Berau and W3A Anekatek Solar, East Sumba. It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - MECB Grantee Approximately 6,000 households in Jack compound, a peri-urban community in Lusaka, Zambia rely on Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) for their water provision. LWSC struggles to meet this demand due to its decaying water distribution infrastructures and intermittent cuts to electricity.  Therefore, water accessibility and quality are major challenges in the compound, burdening residents with unproductive time usage (mostly on women who are forced to wait in long queues to fetch water), decreasing water accountability, increasing residents' risk of water-borne diseases and forcing them to turn to private water vendors.                    As a response to these challenges, MECB formed a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with LWSC to implement MECB's Smart Safe Water Supply Scheme-Scaling Up (SSWS-SU) project. It aims to address these challenges by digging \u201chigh yield\u201d boreholes to increase the amount of water to be pumped, by installing solar pumps to enable 24/7 availability of water, by rehabilitating the existing water distribution piping system and by installing new water kiosks with an innovative dispensing machine that works with unique non-cash tokens to help ensure accountability.  The purpose of the performance evaluation of MECB's Smart Safe Water Scheme Scaling Up (SSWS-SU) Project is to examine how SSWS-SU is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are: (1) to increase access to potable water in Jack compound, (2) to increase time savings through shorter wait times at water kiosks, (3) to increase transparency and equity of water fees, and (4) to increase water revenue.Initial conditions of water access and water use in Jack compound, project implementation, activities, and outputs are also examined to understand the performance and dynamics of the SSWS-SU project. AIR used a qualitative methodological approach to investigate the fidelity of project implementatiion and the ways in which deviations in implementation affected expected project outputs. We also explored changes in key outcomes of interest (e.g., increased access to potable water, shorter wait times at water kiosks, etc.), although the outcome analysis was descriptive rather than causal. This baseline evaluation report provides results on program implementation and performance prior to the commencement of water distribution by MECB. In addition, the evaluation aims to documnet lessons learned and best practices related to the implementation of water distribution projects and the efficacy of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in water management.   The research questions driving thsi evaluation fall into three main areas: (1) the enabling environment (2) the implementation process (3) sustainability.                                                                                                                                     Research questions per each evaluation area are:     Area 1: Enabling Environment     A. Public Private Partnerships    \u00b7   Who are the relevant actors and/or organizations that shape access to water in Jack compound? How do these actors and/or organizations impact how residents access water?     \u00b7   How did MECB establish its partnership with LWSC? How, if at all, did MECB work with other key actors relevant to water access in Jack to establish the project? What challenges, if any, did MECB face in securing this/these partnership(s) and how were they resolved?    B. Access to Water and Usage Behaviors    \u00b7   From where do select Jack residents get their water at baseline? How do Jack residents initially perceive water accessibility, affordability, and reliability? How do residents perceive access for    the most vulnerable (e.g.,those who are physically disabled or those in low socio-economic status households)?     \u00b7   What are the perceptions of water quality at baseline?    \u00b7   What are the costs associated with transporting the water from the MECB kiosk to homes for select residents?    \u00b7   How do households transport, handle, and store water at baseline?     \u00b7   For households with private taps, how is water distributed/sold among family friends, neighbours, and other residents?     \u00b7   What are the water usage patterns and/or behaviors of select Jack residents at baseline?     Area 2: Implementation Process    A. Token System    \u00b7   At baseline, what are the anticipated outcomes of the token system among respondents? What are respondents' perceptions and recommendations for improvement of the token system at baseline? What are respondents' perceptions of the sustainability of the token system at baseline?     B. Implementation Challenges     \u00b7   How, if at all, did the implementation process differ from the original plan proposed by MECB (in the IGP grant contract)? \u00b7   Are there any unintended consequences of the SSWS-SU project within Jack compound?     Area 3: Sustainability \u00b7   How does MECB plan to shift maintenance responsibilities to residents of Jack compound? Is this plan feasible? Why or why not? \u00b7   Does MECB think that the revenue sharing agreement with LWSC is economically viable? Why or why not? How do MECB and LWSC view the sustainability of the private commercial provision of water?  Summary  (purpose, nature, scope, special content characteristics) of different areas of evaluation:     The evaluation questions were investigated using several qualitative methods, including an actor mapping exercise with SSWS-SU stakeholders, key informant interviews (KIIs) with MECB and LWSC officials, other relevant officials, and water providers, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with Jack residents. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official project documents obtained from MECB and Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).    The evaluation of the enabling environment aims to establish a deep understanding of the initial conditions and enabling environment of Jack compound to inform MECB's program activities and prospects for sustainability. The evaluation of the implementation process provides a preliminary analysis of MECB's implementation of the SSWS-SU project. An assessment of Jack residents' perceptions of SSWS-SU's new token system will help identify the challenges and facilitators to residents' potential uptake. Further, this area evaluation provides an overview of the implementation challenges that MECB faced while constructing the project's physical infrastructure, sensitizing the Jack community, and mitigating the potential social and environmental risks of the intervention. The last area of evaluation, sustainability assesses the feasibility of MECB's strategy to ensure the SSWS-SU project's sustainability. We examine the extent to which MECB has built community buy-in and ownership over the project's assets and operations and also assess the revenue sharing agreement between MECB and LWSC, and finally also assess whether the PPP is built upon a sustainable economic model.   Summary (purpose, nature, scope, special content characteristics) of data collection:     1. Actor Mapping: Actor maps are \"visual depiction[S] of key organizations and/or individuals that make up and/or influence a system, as well as their relationships to a given issue and to one another.\"  This was conducted to better understand the relevant actors in the local water sector, their relationships to one another, their interests and their broader influence in shaping water disbursement processes within Jack compound.     2. KIIs: KIIs with different individuals were conducted to gather information on different research questions.     \u00b7   KII with MCA-Z staff focused on implementation challenges and successes, the process of engaging local stakeholders, institutional and political structures and support and program sustainability.    \u00b7   KII with MECB staff focused on the planning and initial implementation process including the main challenges encountered, how MECB overcame these challenges, its process of engaging local partners, and the perceived sustainability of its PPP with LWSC.     \u00b7   KIIs with LWSC officials focused on the nature of LWSC's collaboration with MECB including its initial discussions, staff perspectives on the PPP model, LWSC's current role and mode of engaging with MECB during implementation, challenges and successes throughout implementation, and LWSC's thoughts on the most feasible plans for sustaining this initiative.     \u00b7   KII with NWASCO focused on issues related to water access, quality, affordability, as well as residents' collection and usage patterns. AIR also inquired about PBOs perceptions and expectations regarding the SSWS-SU project and the potential implications it might bring to their businesses.     \u00b7   KIIs with private borehole owners (PBOs) focused on issues related to water access, quality, affordability, as well as residents' collection and usage patterns. AIR also inquired about PBOs perceptions and expectations regarding the SSWS-SU project and the potential implications it might bring to their businesses.     \u00b7   KIIs with community leaders focused on how the community might be affected by the SSWS-SU project's innovations. Specifically, we asked community leaders to provide their perspective on past and current water quality, community level factors that might shape project implementation, and their thoughts on SSWS-SU's prospects for sustainability.     3.  FGDs: This was conducted to understand Jack residents' WASH related perceptions and behaviours at baseline and to gauge their level of sensitization regarding the SSWS-SU project. The FGDs with residents enabled AIR to examine similarities and differences among residents who fetch and use water from different sources and how these choices might affect their perceptions about water accessibility and quality."

The model has been used to evaluate a wide variety of technologies and management strategies, and these analyses have been reported in the scientific and farm-trade literature. Systems research in dairy and beef production remains as the primary purpose of this tool, but the model also provides an effective teaching aid. With the model, students gain a better appreciation for the complexity of livestock forage systems. The learn how small changes affect many parts of the system, causing unanticipated results. They may also use the model to develop a more optimum food production system. When used in extension type teaching, producers can learn more about their farms and obtain information useful in strategic planning. By testing and comparing different options with the model, those offering the greatest economic benefit with acceptable environmental impact can be found.    Input information is supplied to the program through three parameter files. The farm parameter file contains data describing the farm such as crop areas, soil type, equipment and structures used, numbers of animals at various ages, harvest, tillage, and manure handling strategies, and prices for various farm inputs and outputs. The machinery file includes parameters for each machine available for use on a simulated farm.    Simulation output is available in four files, which contain summary tables, report tables, optional tables, and parameter tables. The summary tables provide average performance, environmental impact, costs, and returns for the years simulated. These values consist of crop yields, feeds produced, feeds bought and sold, manure produced, nutrient losses to the environment, production costs, income from products sold, and the net return or profitability of the farm. Values are provided for the average and standard deviation of each over all simulated years. The report tables provide extensive output information including all the data given in the summary tables. In these tables, values are given for each simulated year of weather as well as the mean and variance over all simulated years. Optional tables are available for a closer inspection of how the components of the full simulation are functioning. These tables include very detailed data, often on a daily basis. Parameter tables summarize the input parameters specified for a given simulation. These tables provide a convenient method of documenting the parameter settings used for a simulation."

                "text": "National Wildlife Refuge System Invasive Plant Inventory Pilot Project Invasive species are one of the most pervasive threats to biological integrity, diversity, and    environmental health on units of the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). Invasive species can    alter ecosystem function and structure (e.g., shift fire regimes or nutrient cycling) and change the    distribution, abundance and diversity of native species and communities. The high cost of managing    invasive species combined with decreasing budgets requires that we prioritize which invasive threats to    manage and we use scientifically credible data to inform optimal management decisions and evaluate    progress. A key first step in invasive management is identifying the species of greatest management    concern and conducting an inventory of those species to determine their distribution and abundance.    Inventory data inform management decisions and provide a baseline for evaluating progress. Although    the value of inventory data is well known, inventories are considered a daunting task for many resource    managers because of limited resources or lack of expertise on how to conduct invasive inventories. To    begin addressing these challenges, the NWRS Inventory and Monitoring Initiative and the NWRS    Invasive Species Program initiated the NWRS Invasive Plant Pilot Project (Invasive Pilot) to examine    the diversity of factors influencing how refuges plan and conduct invasive plant inventories. The goals    of the Project are to: (1) evaluate how variation in refuge size, environment, resource availability and    other factors influence planning and implementation of invasive plant inventories and (2) use this    information to inform a NWRS framework or guide for conducting invasive plant inventories. Although    the focus of this effort is on invasive plants, many of the concepts can be applied to other invasive taxa.    This project was administered by invasive plant subject matter experts employed by the U. S. Fish and    Wildlife Service, Utah State University, and Colorado State University."

                "text": "Great Smoky Mountains National Park Aquatic Macroinvertebrates Monitoring Locations These data depict the locations (only) of all Aquatic Macroinvertebrates Monitoring Locations study sites in the park. Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) contains over 3400 km (2000 mi) of pristine waterways. As streams drain the forested ecosystems of the Park, they integrate and reflect conditions in those ecosystems. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are subjected directly to changes in the physical and chemical conditions of the water, and because of this dependent relationship with the water they live in, aquatic macroinvertebrates are good indicators of ecosystem health. They are found in all aquatic environments, are less mobile than many other groups of organisms, and are of a size that makes them easily collectable. Moreover, benthic macroinvertebrates have been shown to be a cost-effective monitoring tool (Lenat 1988). Aquatic biota exhibit responses to a wide array of stressors, including those having synergistic or antagonistic effects. In the Smokies, these stressors include primarily acid deposition and forest changes due to exotic pest infestations. The overall goal of this program is to maintain a Park-wide system of benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring sites to track the environmental health of Park streams, and to detect and quantify changes in conditions. The specific objectives are: to develop long-term aquatic biota data for large streams; to determine correlations among macroinvertebrates, fish, habitat, and water quality monitoring data; and to develop baseline data on aquatic macroinvertebrates.When conducting a monitoring program, the main goal is to analyze long-term data to evaluate changes in condition, and progress toward meeting a management objective. The aquatic macroinvertebrate monitoring program in GRSM is designed to provide this data through repeated sampling over time to answer the question of whether or not a particular benthic macroinvertebrate population displays trends indicative of ecosystem stress. This data relates directly to many other Inventory and Monitoring components in the Park, particularly the fisheries and water quality programs. Additionally, this data provides a baseline dataset for many areas outside of the Park which may be experiencing greater impacts to their aquatic resources.Benthic macroinvertebrates represent an integral part of lotic systems by processing organic matter and providing energy to higher trophic levels; therefore, an understanding of the effects of anthropogenic, as well as natural stressors, on their distribution and abundance is critical for comprehensive impact assessment of streams and rivers (Carter et al. 2006). Changes in macroinvertebrate population relative abundances, life-history traits, and growth rates are sensitive indicators of perturbations and are routinely used when evaluating the impacts of pollution (Carter et al. 2006). The deleterious effects of acidic stream water, for example, are well established, primarily in terms of reduced numbers of species and individuals (Allan 1995). Direct physiological effects and mortality due to acidification and to the subsequent mobilization of toxic metals, have been observed among various groups of aquatic invertebrates (Burton et al. 1985). Indirect effects of acidification also occur, through behavioral responses and alterations of food availability (Allan 1995)."
