The data and inundation results enable coastal flooding analysis and display at high resolution for 118 parks.  The estimated inundation extent was achieved by utilizing a modified bathtub approach as developed by the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Coastal Services Center (CSC) (Allen et al., 2010). The NOAA methodology \u201cattempts to account for local and regional tidal variability and hydrological connectivity\u201d. Sea level change polygon extents consist of 4 model run    scenarios. The maps are based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Two RCPs were chosen for this study, a moderate RCP4.5 and the most extreme RCP8.5. Each RCP was projected to the years 2050 and 2100.  Other data available in this series includes low-lying areas, defined by NOAA as \u201chydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may flood\u201d; the DEM used to model the inundation; and USGS DEMs for selected park units. The estimated extents and model DEM are available in ArcGIS personal geodatabase format. The USGS DEMs are available in geoTIFF format. The extents and model DEM have a UTM projection and NAD83 (2011) datum. The USGS DEMs have a geographic projection, NAD83 horizontal datum, and NAVD88 vertical datum unless noted otherwise.

The Reference Network measures the atmospheric distribution and trends of the three main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO) which is an important indicator of air pollution. The Reference Network measurement program includes continuous in-situ measurements at 4 baseline observatories (global background sites) and 8 tall towers, as well as flask-air samples collected by volunteers at over 50 additional regional background sites and from small aircraft. The air samples are returned to ESRL for analysis where measurements of about 55 trace gases are done. NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network maintains the World Meteorological Organization international calibration scales for CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, and SF6 in air. The measurements of the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network serve as a comparison with measurements made by many other international laboratories, and with regional studies. They are widely used in studies inferring space-time patterns of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases that are optimally consistent with the atmospheric observations. They serve as an early warning for climate \"surprises\". The measurements are also helpful for the ongoing evaluation of remote sensing technologies.  The CCGG cooperative air sampling network effort began in 1967 at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Today, the network is an international effort which includes regular discrete samples from the NOAA ESRL/GMD baseline observatories, cooperative fixed sites, and commercial ships. Air samples are collected approximately weekly from a globally distributed network of sites. Samples are analyzed for Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrogen Gas (H2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6); and by INSTAAR for the stable isotopes of CO2 and CH4 and for many volatile organic compounds (voc) such as ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4) and propane (C3H8). Measurement data are used to identify long-term trends, seasonal variability, and spatial distribution of carbon cycle gases.

Additional facility information is included with calculated combustion energy values, such as industry type (six-digit NAICS code), location (lat, long, zip code, county, and state), combustion unit type, and combustion unit name.   Further identification of combustion energy use is provided by calculating energy end use (e.g., conventional boiler use, co-generation/CHP use, process heating, other facility support) by manufacturing NAICS code. Manufacturing facilities are matched by their NAICS code and reported fuel type with the proportion of combustion fuel energy for each end use category identified in the 2010 Energy Information Administration Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS, http://www.eia.gov/consumption/manufacturing/data/2010/).

Observatory Measurements: NOAA/ESRL/GMD operates four staffed atmospheric baseline observatories from which numerous measurements of greenhouse gases are conducted. These baseline observatories, also known as global background sites, are located in Barrow, Alaska; Mauna Loa, Hawaii; American Samoa; and South Pole, Antarctica. The measured data are baseline levels, trends, and causes of variability of atmospheric gases that have the potential to affect global climate. These observatories were established in order to provide a sampling of the most remote air on the planet so that the true \"background atmosphere\" could be monitored. GMD first began continuous in-situ measurements of CO2 at these observatories in 1973, and added CH4 and CO measurements in the 1980's. The ongoing data set is contingent upon the baseline observatories that are still in use going forward.   A subset of Observatory Measurements for only carbon dioxide (CO2) taken from Observatories is archived separately with digital object identifiers (DOIs) for each of the four observation stations listed above. The observations run from 1973 through the end of 2016. The main portion of this agreement is for the enhanced \"version\" of the more encompassing dataset for all of the different types of observation platforms and gases.

These regions correspond with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program Major River Basin (MRB) study units 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 (Preston and others, 2009). MRB2, covers the South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins. MRB3, covers the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy River basins. MRB4, covers the Missouri River basins. MRB5, covers the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River basins. MRB7, covers the Pacific Northwest River basins. The digital hydrologic network described here represents surface-water pathways (MRB_E2RF1) and associated catchments (MRB_E2RF1WS). It serves as the fundamental framework to spatially reference and summarize explanatory information supporting nutrient SPARROW models (Brakebill and others, 2011; Wieczorek and LaMotte, 2011). The principal geospatial dataset used to support this regional effort was based on an enhanced version of a 1:500,000 scale digital stream-reach network (ERF1_2) (Nolan et al., 2002). Enhancements included associating over 3,500 water-quality monitoring sites to the reach network, improving physical locations of stream reaches at or near monitoring locations, and generating drainage catchments based on 100m elevation data. A unique number (MRB_ID) identifies each reach as a single unit. This unique number is also shared by the catchment area drained by the reach, thus spatially linking the hydrologically connected streams and the respective drainage area characteristics. In addition, other relevant physical, environmental, and monitoring information can be associated to the common network and accessed using the unique identification number."

The IBI provids a consistent theoretical framework for analyzing fish assemblage data. The IBI is an aggregation of 12 biological metrics that are based on the fish assemblage's taxonomic and trophic composition and the abundance and condition of fish. Such multiple-parameter indices are necessary for making objective evaluations of complex systems. The IBI was designed to evaluate the quality of small Midwestern warmwater streams but has been modified for use in many regions (e.g., eastern and western United States, Canada, France) and in different ecosystems (e.g., rivers, impoundments, lakes, and estuaries. The index of biotic integrity is an environmental assessment of a stream based on ecological metrics applied to the resident fish community (Karr, 1981). Twelve metrics address species richness and composition, trophic structure, fish abundance, and fish condition (Table 1). Each metric reflects the condition of one aspect of the fish community and is scored against expectations under reference conditions. Potential scores are 1-poor, 3-intermediate, or 5-the best to be expected. Scores for the 12 metrics are summed to produce the IBI for the site. The IBI is then classified using the system developed by Karr et al. (1986) rating the site from \u201cVery poor\u201d to \u201cExcellent\u201d. Additional information on the strategies underlying the methodology and individual metrics is presented by Plafkin et. al. (1989).The metrics attempt to quantify a park biologist's best professional judgment of the quality of the fish assemblage. The IBI utilizes professional judgment, but in a prescribed manner, and it includes quantitative standards for discriminating the condition of the fish assemblage. Best professional judgmentis involved in choosing both the most appropriate population or assemblage element that is representative of each metric and in setting the scoring criteria. This process can be easily and clearly modified, as opposed to judgments that occur after results are calculated. Each metric is scored against criteria based on expectations developed from appropriate regional reference sites. Metric values approximating, deviating slightly from, or deviating greatly from values occurring at the reference sites are scored as 5, 3, or 1, respectively. The scores of the 12 metrics are added for each station to give an IBI ranging from a maximum of 60 (excellent) to a minimum of 12 (very poor). Additional classifications can be derived from information in State and regional fish texts, by objectively assessing a large statewide database, or by contacting authors/originators of regional IBI programs or pilot studies. Use of the IBI by water resource agencies may result in further modifications. Many modifications have occurred without changing the IBI's basic theoretical foundations.The IBI serves as an integrated analysis because individual metrics may differ in their relative sensitivity to various levels of biological condition. A description and brief rationale for each of the 12 IBI metrics is outlined below. The original metrics described by Karr (1981) for Illinois streams are followed by substitutes used in or proposed for different geographic regions and stream sizes. Because of zoogeographic differences, different families or species are evaluated in different regions, with regional substitutes occupying the same general habitat or niche. The source for each substitute is footnoted below. Species Richness and Composition Metrics: These metrics assess the species richness component of diversity and the health of resident taxonomic groupings and habitat guilds of fishes. Two of the metrics assess assemblage composition in terms of tolerant or intolerant species.Species Richness and Composition Metrics: Metric 1.

Aircraft Program Measurements: Since its inception in 1992, the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network's aircraft program has been dedicated to collecting air samples in vertical profiles over North America. The program's mission is to capture seasonal and inter-annual changes in trace gas mixing ratios throughout the boundary layer and free troposphere. Data collected by the aircraft program provide a view of how the large-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of the measured trace gases change throughout a given year over the continent. The measured data are baseline levels, trends, and causes of variability of atmospheric gases that have the potential to affect global climate.   The historical data set contains measurements from 31 aircraft program missions. The ongoing data set is contingent upon the aircraft program missions that are still in use going forward. At present, most aircraft program flights collect 12 flask samples at different altitudes via a portable, automated sampling system. At a predetermined altitude, the sampling system is simply activated by a toggle switch that is easily accessible to the pilot. Time, location and auxiliary variables such as temperature and relative humidity are logged with each sample and downloaded into the NOAA/ESRL database when the samples are returned to the laboratory. Sampling frequency and height distribution varies at each site, but samples are collected from 500 m above ground to 8000 m above sea level at the majority of aircraft sites. While sampling flights have been conducted at some sites as often as two to three times per week, sample flights at most sites are only carried out once every two to three weeks.   Through the Big Earth Data Initiative (BEDI), ESRL/GMD has taken their data collection and converted files into NetCDF-4, a self-describing format."

                "text": "Species-specific patterns of fine root demography and hydraulic lift among trees of the fall-line sandhills Below ground processes, such as fine root demography and soil water redistribution, can alter carbon, nutrient and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Although these processes are known to differ significantly across broad spatial scales and plant functional types, little is known about the differences among species in narrow geographical scales. Studies were conducted in a group of five tree species that grow in the sandhills of the fall-line region of southeastern United States. Four Quercus species (Q. laevis, Q. incana, Q. margaretta and Q. marilandica) and the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) co-occur in areas of intermediate fertility, but have different distribution  along soil resource gradients. Species differences in fine root demography and hydraulic lift were studied by growing roots of adult trees in field rhizotrons and recording fine root production, death and lifespan and the water potential of the soil near the roots. The effect of variation in resource availability (water and nutrients) on fine root demography was also studied in greenhouse studies using seedlings. The species able to colonize xeric habitats (Q. laevis and Q. incana) exhibited fine roots with greater longevity but lower rates of production, death and percent mortality than species dominant in mesic habitats (Q. margaretta and Q. marilandica). The generalist species (P. palustris) exhibited intermediate fine root demography. Fine root death increased under high resources and under localized drought, especially in mesic species. Fine root production in mesic species was greater at high resource availability and after re-enrichment of dry surface soil. Only xeric Quercus species and the generalist P. palustris exhibited hydraulic lift ability. Consistent with optimality theory, these results suggest that greater fine root lifespan and hydraulic lift ability in xeric and generalist species may favor root persistence in dry soils,  potentially reducing rates of resource loss. In contrast, greater fine root growth in mesic and generalist species may favor competition for resources. Results also indicate that species differences can be substantial even across congeners and narrow spatial scales. Hence, species-specific belowground processes deserve further investigation in order to understand how carbon andnutrient cycling respond to environmental change and shifts in species composition."

                "text": "El Salvador - Production and Business Services Final Performance Evaluation:    To guide the analysis, a research framework composed of the following five research questions was used: (1) How was the PBS Activity designed and why was it designed this way? (2) How was the activity implemented? (3) Did the activity produce its desired results, and what is the extent of the relevant evidence? (4) What was learned about supporting enterprise development and how sustainable are MCC's efforts in this area? and (5) What are the lessons for MCC and other stakeholders from the design and implementation of this activity?    This analysis relies on a mixed-methods approach, in which Mathematica staff collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data from a variety of sources, including administrative records, programmatic reports, and stakeholder interviews. In July 2012, Mathematica staff conducted interviews with MCC, FOMILENIO, Chemonics, and technical service provider staff, as well as members of FOMILENIO's board of directors, an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, representatives from S\u00faper Selectos (a major grocery store chain in El Salvador), PBS participants, and representatives from FOMILENIO-supported enterprises. To formulate primary findings and conclusions, Mathematica staff triangulated qualitative information provided by all interviewed stakeholders and analyzed this information in conjunction with administrative reports and records.  Interim Impact Evaluation:    The Productive Development Project (PDP) was one of three large-scale projects financed under the 2006 compact between the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of El Salvador. The main objective of the PDP was to assist in the development of profitable and sustainable business ventures for poor individuals in El Salvador's Northern Zone. Between 2008 and 2012, the PDP used nearly $72 million in allocated funds to serve over 13,500 participants and create more than 11,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The PDP comprised three activities: Production and Business Services (PBS), Investment Support, and Financial Services. The PBS Activity -- the subject of this impact evaluation and the largest of the three activities -- provided technical and material assistance to farmers and small-scale producers to support the Northern Zone's dairy, fruit, horticulture, handicrafts, tourism, forestry, and coffee sectors.  The design for the impact evaluation of the PBS Activity is a randomized rollout design, in which some producers were offered PBS assistance several months before other producers were offered similar assistance. The goal of this design is to attain the highest level of rigor possible without significantly altering existing implementation plans. The evaluation is limited to three value chains: (1) handicrafts, (2) dairy, and (3) horticulture. Among all value chains in the PBS, these three chains were most amenable to random assignment, and were expected to yield impacts in the one-year interim timeline specified for the evaluation.   Treatment groups were offered PBS assistance in the first implementation phase (beginning in late 2009 for handicrafts and mid-2010 in the case of the dairy and horticulture chains) and control groups in the dairy and horticulture chains were offered PBS assistance roughly one year after the treatment group. As over 15,000 individuals had participated in the PBS Activity by August 2012, this evaluation sample of 1,736 individuals (518, 593, and 625 in the dairy, horticulture, and handicrafts chains, respectively) includes only 11 percent of the individuals served under the activity."

                "text": "Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) While the Fujita and Saffir-Simpson Scales characterize tornadoes and hurricanes respectively, there is no widely used scale to classify snowstorms. The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) developed by Paul Kocin of The Weather Channel and Louis Uccellini of the National Weather Service characterizes and ranks high-impact Northeast snowstorms. These storms have large areas of 10 inch snowfall accumulations and greater. NESIS has five categories: Extreme, Crippling, Major, Significant, and Notable. The index differs from other meteorological indices in that it uses population information in addition to meteorological measurements. Thus NESIS gives an indication of a storm's societal impacts. NESIS scores are a function of the area affected by the snowstorm, the amount of snow, and the number of people living in the path of the storm. The aerial distribution of snowfall and population information are combined in an equation that calculates a NESIS score which varies from around one for smaller storms to over ten for extreme storms. The raw score is then converted into one of the five NESIS categories. The largest NESIS values result from storms producing heavy snowfall over large areas that include major metropolitan centers. For details on how NESIS scores are calculated at the National Climatic Data Center, see Squires and Lawrimore (2006)."

In the summer of 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated water quality sampling on inlets, outlets and within-pool portions of Agassiz Pool, Agassiz NWR largest wetland impoundment. Current water quality monitoring was initiated in response to potential threats identified by two recent studies which measured sediment and nutrient loading within Agassiz Pool, its tributaries and outlets (Schottler and Engstrom, 2011; USGS, 2012). The goal of current water quality monitoring at Agassiz NWR is to: 1) track trends in water quality and quantity conditions relative to Watershed and Refuge management actions and 2) provide a better understanding of sediment and nutrient dynamics within Agassiz Pool. Drought conditions during the 2012 sampling period allowed for the measurement of water quality conditions within Agassiz Pool with very little influence from incoming or outgoing flows. These data may be important in the future when comparing nutrient cycling capabilities under various water level management scenarios. Water monitoring data, aerial imagery and on-site inspections coordinated with the drawdown of Agassiz Pool in 2012 indicate extensive sheet flow, vegetation disturbance and discrete periods of channel formation and sediment scour within Agassiz Pool. Further monitoring is needed to understand the relationship between Pool levels, the management of the Ditch-11 Outlet WCS and streamflow.The initial results suggest that the 2012 drawdown was effective in removing water, drying soils and disturbing vegetation and soils in an isolated area around the Main WCS. Sampling results for all sites in 2012 produced predictably low Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) concentrations due to the lack of runoff during the sampling period. Samples collected in the non-flowing waters of Agassiz Pool produced consistently low TSS concentrations, while samples from the inlet, channel and outlets sites varied widely. Relative to the other samples, Ditch-11 and the Agassiz Pool North Channel (within Pool) samples produced consistently high TSS concentrations when sampled. The ratio of inorganic to organic material within sampled sediments was found to be primarily inorganic at inlet and outlet sites (sites with active streamflow) and primarily organic at in-Pool (non-flowing) sites. In 2012, TSS concentrations were so low that the composition of sediments is considered less significant than it would be during periods of high sediment transport. Water samples analyzed for various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus at inlet and outlet sites were consistent with data collected by the USGS in 2008-2010 (2012). Although some concentrations were slightly elevated, sample results were mostly below the available state standards for each constituent. In-Pool samples, along with continuous water quality parameter data indicate a wetland system with pronounced primary and secondary production. Although this type of nutrient cycling is normal for wetlands, the dramatic changes in water chemistry over short time periods in Agassiz Pool may indicate accelerated cycling due to an excess of nutrients. This condition should continue to be closely monitored to better define the range of water chemistry changes in the Pool and to consider potential impacts for habitats and wildlife. Of particular concern is the influence of nutrient concentrations and availability in exotic narrow leaf cattail production and the potential for large algal blooms if the current nutrient dynamics were to shift, especially with elevated concentrations of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP). It is likely that large volumes of nitrogen and phosphorus are contained within Refuge ditch and wetland substrate, meaning that the availability of these constituents may be slow to reflect any changes in management or upstream best management practices."

Ecological studies have suggested that protecting 10 to 40% of regional ecosystems is needed to preserve diversity, while public preferences for MPA size have not been modeled.  We conduct a choice experiment to estimate the existence value of protecting species and habitat diversity on the sea floor in areas that vary in size and allowable uses of the water column, and apply a latent class specification to accommodate taste parameter heterogeneity. Results identify three latent classes in the sample, and suggest that while protecting areas as ecological reserves is utility-increasing for most size/use combinations, smaller reserves with liberal use policies produce the largest increases.  Our research suggests diminishing marginal utility for MPA sizes that are substantially smaller than ranges often cited, and the distinct latent classes underscore the need to question the assumption of homogeneous preferences when evaluating MPA policy."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

(2012). Five CAUs were deployed at each survey site. Climate sites were established in Timore-Leste by CREP in October 2012 to establish ecological baselines for climate change by measuring multiple features of the coral reef environment (in addition to the data described herein) over time.   CAUs, constructed in-house by CREP, are composed of two 10 x 10 cm flat, square, gray PVC plates, stacked 1 cm apart, and are attached to the benthos by SCUBA divers using stainless steel threaded rods. Deployed on the seafloor for a period of time, calcareous organisms, primarily crustose coralline algae and encrusting corals, recruit to these plates and accrete/calcify carbonate skeletons over time. By measuring the change in weight of the CAUs, the reef carbonate accretion rate can be calculated for that time period, measured in grams per centimeter per year.  Laboratory experiments reveal calcification rates of crustose coralline algae (CCA) are strongly correlated to seawater aragonite saturation state. Predictions of reduced coral calcification rates, due to ocean acidification, suggest that coral reef communities will undergo ecological phase shifts as calcifying organisms are negatively impacted by changing seawater chemistry. CAUs are used by CREP to assess the current effects of changes in seawater carbonate chemistry on calcification and accretion rates of calcareous and fleshy algae.  These calcification rate data for Timor-Leste, along with other data collected at the climate survey sites (water temperature and chemistry, invertebrate biodiversity, and benthic cover, all archived separately), serve as a baseline for detecting changes associated with changing seawater chemistry and can be used to help scientists assess and understand how Timor-Leste's coral reefs are responding to ocean acidification. The data can be accessed online via the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Ocean Archive."

The final report will include information from the impact evaluation (IE) of the grid component of the project as a complement to the data collected on the PE for the solar panel component. The PE will utilize the IE data--understanding that it examined a different population-as a benchmark, along with the additional data gathered from field visits, the literature review on the solar panels, and basic implementation to evaluate the Sub-Activity.  All of the evaluation questions are derived from the program logic and are ultimately linked to the economic rate of return (ERR). The ERR measures the effectiveness of a program by contrasting the discounted flows of costs and benefits of a specific intervention. This is directly tied to the outcome of reduced price of electricity, which should yield a positive ERR for the intervention. Data from the IE of the RE Sub-Activity shows an ERR of 19.4 percent. This specific aspect of the RE Sub-Activity is assumed to yield a similar positive ERR.

                "text": "Ghana - Agriculture - Feeder Roads The Ghana Millennium Development Authority's (MiDA) Agriculture Project within the Government of Ghana's Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation is design to improve farming in a number of areas. Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

                "text": "Nicaragua - Transportation The evaluation examines impacts of the Transportation Project in three ways. First, we calculate economic rates of return associated with reduced user costs for each rehabilitated road - and for the project in aggregate - making use of the before and after measures of road use, detailed data on project implementation and costs, and models that project changes in usage, costs, and benefits over time.   We also examine changes in the availability and cost of common consumption goods that can be attributed to the transportation project. This component of the analysis relies on a survey of retail establishments that targets goods in the Cansta Basica or basic basket that is used in Nicaragua to track consumer prices. Data was collected both before and after construction in communities both on and away from rehabilitated roads. The survey design therefore facilitates measurement of changes in price and availability of goods relative to a relevant comparison group.   The evaluation also examines changes in household consumption using a similar pre- and post- rehabilitation data collection methodology. The consumption measures for this component of the evaluation are derived from responses to household surveys implemented for the Rural Business Development (RBD) portion of the Nicaragua compact. While the bulk of the respondents to this survey are outside the zone of influence of the road rehabilitation, we identify more than one-hundred households within the zone of influence of the rehabilitated roads. It is important to recognize that the data for this component of the report was collected for a different purpose and respondents are not a representative sample of households in the treatment and control areas. Thus these results are intended to be suggestive and provide some insight on the robustness of results from the survey of retail establishments. These surveys do not provide unbiased estimates of the transportation project on the affected population."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

                "text": "Nicaragua - Rice and Banana Farmers This report is an impact evaluation of two components of the Rural Business Development Program (RBD) in Nicaragua, specifically the components benefitting rice and plantain farmers on Nicaragua\u2019s Pacific coast. The RBD program helped finance irrigation equipment, inputs, and extension services for plantain producers, as well as extension, inputs, and drying patios for rice producers in 2009 and 2010; the price of rice is a function of its moisture content, and by increasing access to drying patios the RBD program sought to increase the value of sales by producers. Using a unique data set collected for the evaluation, average impacts of the RBD program on participating plantain farmers were estimated using difference-in-differences, while average impacts of the rice component on beneficiaries were estimated using fixed effects regressions. Estimated program impacts were combined with administrative cost data to calculate an internal rate of return for the plantain program and for one aspect of the rice program (construction of drying patios).  Key results of the evaluation are:     -Estimated impacts suggest that the RBD rice program raised yields and revenues by 11% in the 2009 - 2010 growing season and 18% in 2010 - 2011 on average relative to the yields and revenues beneficiaries would have obtained without the program.     -The estimated ERR of the drying patio component of the RBD rice program ranges from 7% under the assumption of a five year lifespan for drying patios to 27% when assuming a 20 year lifespan.     -No ERR was estimated for the input/extension component of the rice program; part of the value of the extension/input bundles received by beneficiaries was to be paid back by each beneficiary farmer to his or her cooperative, and the sum total of payments was to serve as seed money for credit funds managed by cooperatives in future years. The  reliance of future benefits of this program component on farmer repayment performance makes its long-term value uncertain; therefore I chose to focus my ERR calculation on the drying patios.     -While average impacts and the drying patio ERR are both positive, RBD rice program impacts are estimated imprecisely, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that average impacts of the program on yields and revenues were zero.     -Estimated impacts of the RBD plantain program were large and significant for revenues and yields of first quality plantains (harvested plantains come in three different quality grades).     -The average impact of the RBD program on sales suggests that the program raised the value of plantain sales by 72% relative to what beneficiaries would have obtained without the RBD program.     -I use the estimated impact on revenues as well as administrative data on production costs and program costs to estimate the ERR of the plantain program.     -The plantain ERR ranges from -23% when assuming a lifespan of 5 years for irrigation equipment and 13% when assuming a lifespan of 20 years.     -The apparent discrepancy between large impacts on sales and the modest ERR is a reflection of the high cost per beneficiary of the program, which was around $15,062 per farmer for the cohort studied here (around $3.6 million divided by 239 beneficiaries)."

The West Grassland area consists of 26,690 hectares of federal, state, and private native pasture and seasonal wetlands representing the largest tract of waterfowl habitat in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Subsurface tile drains, designed to remove saline water from the root zone of agricultural crops, have been installed in irrigated farmland of the western San Joaquin Valley since 1960. Although subsurface drainage water contains elevated concentrations of selenium as well as other naturally occurring trace elements and salts, it was used for wetland management for several decades. In the early 1980s it was discovered that selenium in the drainwater caused malformations and reproductive failure in waterfowl at the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge. Selenium levels in waterfowl tissue where also high enough to warrant the issuance of human health advisories. Beginning in 1985, Agricultural drainwater was no longer applied directly to wetlands, but wetland water supply channels continued to be used periodically to convey agricultural drainwater through wetland areas to the San Joaquin River. Since September of 1996 a new drainwater management program the Grassland Bypass Project (GBP), has been diverting the agricultural drainwater through the San Luis Drain, thus removing drainwater from Grassland area channels that are used to supply wetlands. The purpose of this project is to provide a timely assessment of the degree to which drainwater management initiatives have indeed reduced toxicological risk to wildlife in the area. Selenium levels in most bird eggs (93.5%) were below the 6.0 ug/g level of concern. Somewhat elevated selenium concentrations in fish, tadpole, and invertebrate samples collected mainly from ditches and canals indicate that the selenium problem in the South Grassland area has improved but remains unresolved. Full recovery of the Grassland area wetland ecosystems may not yet be fully realized for two potential reasons: (A) recycling of a persistent reservoir of residual selenium, and (B) continuing input of additional selenium into the ecosystems."

Two hour searches by a two person team were conducted along specific transects in a moist soil management unit, rice fields, and fallowed rice fields, twice a month between March and July, and once a month between August and November for two years. All amphibians seen or heard were recorded, or captured when possible, and examined for gross malformations. Small dip nets were used to collect tadpoles for external examination and growth observations. Three herbicides [Stam M-4 (propanil), Grazon P+D (picloram + 2,4-D) and Arrosolo (propanil + molinate)] that were approved for use, and used on the Refuge during the study, were tested for toxicity in the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay - Xenopus (FETAX) of these chemicals to larval amphibians. Dose-response curves are presented and the LC50s were calculated for Grazon P+D and Arrosolo (33% propanil, 33% molinate). Stam M-4 did not yield a definitive test. The LC50 for Grazon P+D was between 25 and 50 mg/L and for Arrosolo the LC50 was 13.5 mg/L. Calculated exposure concentration of Arrosolo used in rice farming on the Refuge was less than 0.6 mg/L, which is 200 times lower than the LC50 determined in the FETAX assay. Fourteen species of frogs, toads and salamanders were recorded on the Refuge during this study. Three species (three-toed amphiuma, western lesser siren and pig frog) were not previously recorded in Chambers County, Texas. Six species of amphibians recorded from Chambers County (Dixon 1987) were not seen during this study (Table 1). In August the moist soil management unit generally contained the largest population of amphibians averaging 26 individuals per hectare and represented 10 species. The rice fields had the second largest population of amphibians and averaged 24 individuals per hectare, representing 11 species, during July. The rice field was usually drained and left to dry out in August for harvesting. The fallowed rice fields had only eight species of amphibians and much lower densities. These fields were not flooded and stayed dry for long time periods during the drought period of 1999 and 2000. Surveys in the months of December, January, or February did not yield any amphibians along the transects. There were no malformed frogs, toads or tadpoles collected during this study which indicates that the herbicides currently used on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge are not having a measurable adverse effect on the amphibian populations. Habitat alteration such as discing, leveling, and terracing the area for rice planting appeared to have a large but short-term negative effect on the presence, reproduction and abundance of amphibians. The role of concentrating predators such as birds, snakes and mammals, in the moist soil unit and the rice fields on the amphibian populations was not evaluated, but appears as if it could be substantial."

Fishing is restricted to designated areas. Rice Lake, though not  open to fishing, is an important spawning area for northern pike. A common problem confronting the refuge fishery is reduced dissolved oxygen levels during the winter months. This problem limits the major fish populations to species tolerant of low levels of oxygen, (i.e., northern pike, yellow perch and bullheads). A second problem is limited predation on bullheads which leads to overpopulation and stunted growth. Fishing opportunities on the Rice Lake Refuge are limited, but increased fishing can be provided with minor changes in refuge public fishing regulations. The sport fishery can be improved by reduction and control of non-desirable species. This plan was developed in concert with the refuge manager, Rice Lake National Wildlife Refuge by the fishery management biologist, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Iron River, Wisconsin. Input was provided by the refuge staff and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This version updates a previous plan produced in June 1980. The purpose of the plan is to present a management scheme which will make optimum use of the fishery resource and be compatible with state and refuge objectives."

Significant continental-scale loss and degredation of wetlands led to establishment of some of the regions\u2019 largest wetland complexes as National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) and state Wildlife Management Areas (WMA). Effective management should focus on mimicking the wet-dry cycle of wetlands, which increases primary productivity by accelerating decomposition of accumulated detritus, releasing otherwise bound nutrients. Moreover, early seral stage wetland vegetation, e.g., sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), is often more nutritious and preferred by migratory birds than late-seral stage species more tolerant of anoxic conditions (e.g., watermilfoil [Myriophyllum sibiricum]). The frequency, timing, and duration of drawdowns are important factors in determining which vegetation community phases will be expressed within a wetland. General recommendations exist for assisting managers with this decision; however the predictive ability of conceptual models remains poor when applied at local scales.  The first component of this project is designed to reduce that management uncertainty by:    \u2022 Developing a conceptual wetland state-and-transition model (STM) to inform management    \u2013 Use existing literature to develop a draft STM for semi-permanently flooded wetlands (80% complete)    \u2013 Incorporate temporal scale using historical data collected during site visits    \u2022 Defining vegetation community phases within states using empirical data (25% complete)    \u2013 Ecological site descriptions and NVCS associations do not exist for wetland communities, necessitating this step    \u2013 Abiotic characteristics and indicator species for phases will be identified    \u2022 Designing an efficient monitoring scheme to inform management (15% complete)    \u2013 Determine wetland condition (i.e., state and phase) using vegetation community phase indicator species    \u2013 STM and current condition define potential management actions to either perpetuate the current state or move a system to another state    \u2022 Providing an analytical framework to estimate transition probabilities among states and phases at the local scale    \u2013 Monitoring of wetland response to management actions will allow estimation of transition probabilities among states and phases in response to management, i.e., reduce the uncertainty of predicted outcomes of water level manipulations in achieving desired states/phases.  Pilot field data collection to define states and community phases, describe relationships between phases and abiotic attributes, and identify indicator species for phases began at eight refuges in 2014. A spatially-balanced random sample of points within each wetland was visited. Canopy cover estimates of all wetland plant species and abiotic conditions (i.e., water depth, pH, salinity, specific conductivity, temperature, soil characteristics) were recorded. Data from 1434 sample points and 154 species were included in analyses to identify vegetation community phases and abiotic gradients correlated with phases. Two more field seasons following these methods will be used to design a long-term monitoring scheme, sustainable with expected station capacity, that will iteratively reduce the uncertainty of wetland management.    The second component of this project will be to link regional migratory bird objectives to local-scale management across the Intermountain West and western Prairie Pothole Region. This will facilitate coordinated wetland management across stations that provide important migrating and breeding habitat for migratory birds. Stations currently participating in the project include Bear Lake, Camas, Grays Lake, and Malheur NWRs in USFWS Region 1 and Bowdoin, Fish Springs, Lee Metcalf, and Medicine Lake NWRs in Region 6."

Wetland management actions often mimic natural disturbance processes in order to maintain ecological function in modified systems. Objectives for semi-permanently flooded wetland habitats within these regions typically focus on one of the two following approaches to management: 1) managing for wetland function to provide a desired plant community, or 2) managing to provide habitat for a specified population size and/or life-history requirement(s) of    focal wildlife species. For example, sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), a pioneering wetland plant species, is more nutritious and often more preferred by herbivorous migratory birds than species more tolerant of anoxic conditions such as shortspike watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). Hence, management objectives for semi-permanently flooded wetlands often include maintaining a relatively high abundance of sago pondweed for the benefit of migratory birds.  The primary disturbance process of management interest in semi-permanently flooded wetland habitats is the dynamic wet/dry hydrological cycle, which is a key driver of wetland productivity and vegetation community structure. Water level changes (either managed or natural) are perterbations that influence nutrient turnover rates, vegetation, aquatic    invertebrates, and resource availability for wetland-dependent wildlife. Wetland systems can respond to perturbations in a non-linear fashion with multiple \u2018equilibrial\u2019 states, and more ephemeral vegetation community phases within states, possible. The frequency, timing, and duration of drawdowns (natural or managed) are important factors in determining which vegetation community phases are expressed within a semi-permanently flooded wetland area. The ability to predict the response of vegetation to water level changes varies depending on the knowledge of the wetland system being managed and life history characteristics of plants.  The first component of this project is to build a common management framework for semipermanently flooded wetland habitats across the three regions. The framework will incorporate ecological processes, and site and management potentials, to define a range of states and vegetation community phases within states."

The largest colony of black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) on the refuge is located there and the densities of cackling Canada geese (B. canadensis minima) and emperor geese (Chen canagica) are the highest for 16 geographical strata on the coastal delta (Stehn 1986). Pacific greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) are also present in limited numbers. Kokechik Bay has been the location of previous ecological investigations of geese (Eisenhauer and Kirkpatrick 1977, Garrett et al. 1983, Scanlon and Jarvis 1984, Garrett and Wege 1985, Petersen 1987) and vegetation patterns (Jackson 1981). Most recently, the Alaska Fish and Wildlife Research Center (AFWRC) has studied the relationship between arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpe-s) predation and goose productivity (Anthony et al. 1987). As a result, the data set for this area spans one of the largest number of years for any region on the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta (Y-K delta), and its importance lies in the historical perspective it provides to future management strategies. For these reasons, as well as in response to requests by native groups and resource agencies within the Pacific Flyway, YDNWR initiated an ecological study in 1988 of waterfowl and their predators at Kokechik Bay."

                "text": "Assessment of Contaminants in the Wetlands and Open Waters of the Great Salt Lake, Utah, 1996-2000 In 1996 and 1997, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) Utah Field Office undertook a comprehensive assessment of contaminants at over 30 wetland sites around the Great Salt Lake (GSL), in northern Utah. At 4,400 km2 (1,700 mi2), the GSL is the 4th largest natural water body west of the Mississipi River and the largest saline lake in the continental United States. The GSL supports hemispherically significant numbers (measured in percent of global population) of a number of bird species including Wilson\u2019s phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), black-necked stilt (Hymantopus mexicanus), snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and others. We assessed important avian habitats on the lake including freshwater and estuarine \u201ctransitional\u201d wetlands on the GSL\u2019s southern and eastern shores, and the open waters of the lake. Trace metals and organic constituents were measured in over 600 samples of sediments, invertebrates, fish and avian eggs; biomarkers of exposure and/or effect (acetylcholinesterase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase enzymes, endocrine hormones 17\u00e2-estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites) were measured in fish as well. In the open waters of the lake, investigation focused on sediments, brine shrimp, and liver tissue from eared grebes, which forage on the lake in the fall and winter as part of a protracted migratory stop-over where they use the lake to undergo a complete feather molt and replacement. Results of this investigation indicated that in general while a number of anthropogenically generated constituents could be observed in sediments and biota around the GSL, there were only a few locations where these constituents were present at levels of concern for the health or management of migratory bird populations. Biomarker data did not indicate that there were any consistent trends in exposure to constituents associated with the biomarkers in fish. Follow-up studies were performed in 1999 and 2000 in areas where data indicated that birds might be exposed to elevated contaminant concentrations. These included an investigation of elevated mercury concentrations in eggs of birds and contaminated sediments at the outfall of an industrial/irrigation canal in southern Farmington Bay, and sediments contaminated with metals associated with mining on the south shoreline of the GSL. These investigations concluded that sediment-foraging birds using a localized area of southern Farmington Bay may be exposed to concentrations of mercury and other contaminants that could cause adverse effects (e.g., impacts to growth, reproduction and/or survival), and that there were localized areas of elevated selenium exposure, associated with the operations and past waste management practices of a large copper smelting facility located on the south shore of the GSL. Data collected during this study also supported a hypothesis that mercury, possibly originating from atmospheric deposition, was being captured by biota within the open waters of the lake where it could be bioaccumulated by birds that use the lake as migratory stop-over habitat. Findings from this study have been used since their collection to inform additional efforts to manage and improve avian and other wildlife habitat on the GSL, including the establishment of a site-specific water quality standard for selenium in the wetlands and open waters of the GSL; and further investigation of the origin, bioavailability and effects of mercury exposure to birds in the GSL ecosystem."

However, since the Museum is a private organization not affiliated with the Chilean government or its agencies, its directors required an agreement with a non-profit organization in order for them to agree to allow NOAA to digitize their data and to make those digitized data free and unrestricted to the world community. This effort required some discretion as well as the intervention of a non-profit since the museum specifically expressed a desire not to work with the Chilean national meteorological service. CD-ROMs containing the images were sent to NCDC via the National Weather Service International Activities Office.

In response to declines in reef fishes, the Hawaii state legislature created the West Hawaii Regional Fishery Management Area in 1998 to improve fishery resources (Act 306). The West Hawaii Aquarium Project (WHAP) was funded by the Hawaii Coral Reef Initiative to monitor fish populations and quantify the habitats in this region. During initial funding under Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) in 1998-99, 23 permanent study sites were established, positioned in all of the proposed Fish Replenishment Areas (FRAs).

Previously, S5\u2019s primary water source was from the Roadside drainage, a draw that also contained two ponds.  Units S1\u2013S4 received water during high river flows from the Green River through an inlet structure.  Irrigation drainage studies conducted 1986\u20131989 identified selenium concentrations capable of reducing waterfowl production and causing embryo deformation.  High concentrations of selenium were also found in sediment, plants, invertebrates, and fish.  Roadside ponds were filled or drained in 1996.  Testing in 1997 revealed that Sheppard Bottom, specifically units S5 and S3, still had high levels of selenium that would eventually accumulate to unsafe levels.  In 2001, dikes within Sheppard Bottom were removed to connect S5 to the river during high flows.  Units S5 and S3 were reconfigured at this time.  It was believed units S1\u2013S4 would not accumulate selenium from Roadside drainage due to construction of a protective levee. Moreover, it was expected that selenium would be flushed from unit S5 by high river flows.  For several years S5 did receive water during high river flows.  In 2007, preliminary sampling suggested restructuring was reducing selenium in S5, but sample sizes were small and did not include sediment or plankton.  Sheppard Bottom was sampled again in 2015 by Utah State University; low water levels precluded all planned samples from being collected. However, high levels of selenium were detected in the reduced number of samples collected."

The purpose of the profile is to describe the extent, components, functioning, history, and treatment of these wetlands. It is intended to provide a useful reference to relevant scientific information and a synthesis of the available literature.  The world range of Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) is limited to a ribbon of freshwater wetlands within 200 km of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, extending from mid-Maine to mid-Florida and Mississippi. Often in inaccessible sites and difficult to traverse, cedar wetlands contain distinctive suites of plant species. Highly valued as commercial timber since the early days of European colonization of the continent, the cedar and its habitat are rapidly disappearing. This profile describes the Atlantic white cedar and the bogs and swamps it dominates or codominates throughout its range, discussing interrelationships with other habitats, putative origins and migration patterns, substrate biogeochemistry, associated plant and animal species (with attention to those that are rare, endangered, or threatened regionally or nationally), and impacts of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Research needs for each area are outlined. Chapters are devoted to the practices and problems of harvest and management, and to an examination of a large preserve recently acquired by the USFWS, the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina."

Some ponds contain water for long periods of time and others briefly. Managed ponds have different wet/dry cycles than unmanaged ponds . In addition, control of willow invasion by chemical and mechanical means represents levels of perturbation that may affect amphibians. This report summarizes three years of field investigations on these animals in this dynamic environment.  Total amphibian species richness for the refuge was 12. Species richness among ponds ranged from 2 to 10; modal number of species per pond was 4. Number of frog species ranged from 2 to 10 per pond. Two species of salamanders were encountered: Siren intermedia and Notophthalmus viridescens. Average number of species in treatment ponds (4.33) was nearly identical to the average number in notreatment ponds (4.25) and not significantly different. Number of tadpole captures per trap night in minnow traps (a measure of relative abundance) in treated ponds (0.722) was slightly higher than captures per trap night in notreatment ponds (0.594) but the difference was not significant. Analysis of body size relationships in Leopard Frog samples obtained during the same sampling period showed that disk and herbicide treatments do not directly affect body sizes and development of this species. The variable responses to changing water levels by reproductive adult amphibians create the complex interplay of management treatments (mostly drawdown schedules) with water levels, natural water loss from evaporation, frog responses to water dynamics, species larval developmental periods, and food availability from pond flora. The primary conclusion is that frog populations apparently have not been adversely or directly affected by management treatments of disking or herbicide applications."

It is one of only six places in the United States where four or more physiographic regions overlap (Loomis, 1937). This rare convergence of landscapes led to and sustains tremendous species diversity in the Cache River area \u2014 making it possible to find plants and animal usually regarded as belonging to Louisiana and Minnesota, the southwest or east central sections of the nation, all jumbled together within shouting distance.  The diversity of the Cache River area truly is impressive. Floodplain forests along the Cache River contain a greater variety of bottomland tree species than any other stream in Illinois (Illinois Department of Natural Resouces, 1997c), including individual bald cypress trees more than 1,000 years old and 12 individual trees recorded as state champions (Illinois Department of Natural Resources, 1997).  In fact, surveys have found 86 freshwater fish species, 230 macroinvertebrates, 10 species of crayfish and shrimp, 52 species of amphibians and reptiles (Phillippi, Burr, & Brandon, 1986), 23 species of mussels (Illinois Natural History Survey, 2011), 128 breeding songbird species and 49 species of mammals (Illinois Department of Natural Resources, 1997c). Finally, the Illinois Natural Heritage database records 99 species considered critically imperiled (66 classified as endangered, 33 as threatened) in the Cache River watershed.  Because of its tremendous biological diversity and uniqueness, the Cache River area has earned several significant distinctions. The Cache River Wetlands are recognized internationally by The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands as a \u201cWetland of International Importance\u201d; the Cache is one of 34 sites in the United States (The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands). Nationally, a portion of the Lower Cache Swamp (including Buttonland Swamp and Section 8 Woods) and Little Black Slough are designated a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. National Park Service in recognition of those areas\u2019 \u201cnational significance in illustrating the natural heritage of the United States (National Natural Landmark Program).  As a testament to the area\u2019s statewide significance, there are 62 areas within the Cache watershed recognized by the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission as important for their natural character, including eight dedicated Nature Preserves and 60 Illinois Natural Area Inventory sites. Although the Cache River basin makes up only 1.5 percent of the land area in Illinois, the inventory also found that it contains 23 percent of the state\u2019s remaining high-quality barrens habitat, 11.5 percent of the high-quality floodplain forest habitat and 91 percent of the high-quality forested swamp."

To protect the ecological processes which have sculpted the current Refuge, and to augment the habitat types presently represented in the Refuge. future protection efforts should focus on three areas:  1.The matrix of northern hardwood-spruce-fir forest that links Little Cherry and Big Cherry Ponds.  2. The seepage swamp south of Big Cherry Pond 3. The John's River Corridors -- i.e. where the River flows between Big and Little Cherry Ponds and \"The Deadwater''."

These wetlands consist largely of tidal marshes and open water ponds. Salt evaporator ponds have been in this landscape for over 150 years (Ver Planck 1958) and are heavily used by shorebirds, waterfowl and other wildlife species (Anderson 1970, Accurso 1992, Takekawa et al. 2001, Warnock et al. 2002). Salt ponds, and former salt ponds now managed as wildlife habitat, provide the majority of the roosting and (for some species) foraging habitat for waterbirds in the San Francisco Bay. The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project (Restoration Project), of which the Refuge and California Department of Fish and Wildlife's (CDFW, also CDFG) Eden Landing Ecological Reserve are a part, is implementing a large-scale plan to convert 15,100 acres of former salt ponds into tidal and managed wetland habitats (SBSPRP 2007).While the restoration of former salt ponds to tidal marsh will increase habitat for species that depend on tidal marshes, it also will reduce the overall pond habitats available for waterbirds. However, through adaptive management, the Restoration Project is committed to maintaining \"baseline\" levels of waterbirds in this site of international importance along the Pacific Flyway (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2013). The Restoration Project has committed to retaining between 10-50% of the 15,100 total Project acres as ponds that are managed largely for waterbirds, but information is needed to ensure that the habitat requirements of large numbers of waterbirds can be met with reduced pond acreage. Monthly ground-based surveys, conducted in former and currently active salt ponds by the U.S. Geological Survey San Francisco Bay Estuary Field Station (USGS) and San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory (SFBBO) have been ongoing since 2002 and 2005, respectively, however, these surveys began after the Restoration Project started. Thus, baseline (i.e., historical) numbers remain largely unknown for many waterbird species prior to the initiation of the Restoration Project. However, in the 1980's, state and federal biologists conducted monthly aerial surveys of waterbirds on all of the salt ponds in the South Bay. These data were recently rediscovered and scanned through a cooperative effort with USGS. In 2009, the USGS scanned these datasheets, and a Refuge intern began the process of entering data into a modified version of SFBBO's current waterbird survey database. In 2010, SFBBO and the Refuge received support from the USFWS Inventory & Monitoring Program, with the goal of completing entry of historical data and analyzing these data to compare historical and current waterbird numbers in Eden Landing Ecological Reserve and the Newark, Alviso, Mowry and Ravenswood salt pond complexes. A metadata report describing the datasets, collection methods, and potential caveats, was submitted previously by SFBBO (Demers & Tokatlian 2012).In this report, we describe the methods we used to compare the current and baseline (historical) datasets and present our findings on the current and historical patterns of abundance and distribution for nine guilds and several individual species of interest to the Refuge, CDFW and Restoration Project. We also compare changes in community structure from the historical to the current data, focusing on changes in patterns of species richness and abundance. We also describe work conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis, to develop a \"conversion factor\" that enabled current (ground-based) survey data to be compared with historical (aerial-based) survey data."

The natural area is of special significance because it represents the highest quality and most diverse natural ,.,etland left along the lower Cache River in southern Illinois. It is unique because of its geographical location and physiographical complexity. It has natural communities of southern affinity, uncommon and relict species, trees of exceptional age and size, and habitats for a diversity of fish and wildlife species.  The natural area provides opportunities for ecological research projects and educational studies. It serves as a refuge for native plants and animals. The swamps are important in helping to improve water quality and in reducing the siltation loads of water draining into the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The natural area provides a variety of incidental benefits related to fur harvest, honey production, boating, hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities.  This report is the product of a study to determine the methodology for preserving the natural wetlands along the lower Cache River in southern Illinois.

The study area contained about 3.1 million wetland basins (28,490 km\u00b2). Wetland area (ha per km\u00b2) was highest on service-owned land; wetland-basin density was greatest on service easements. Temporary and seasonal wetlands were underrepresented and lakes were overrepresented on service-owned land. Seventy-eight percent of all basins were less than 0.41 ha. Cropland dominated private land. Pond density decreased from 4.4/km\u00b2 in 1987 to 3.4/km\u00b2 in 1990 and pond area, from 7.2 ha/km\u00b2 to 2.7 ha/km\u00b2. The density of the blue-winged teal was greatest (3.4 pairs/km\u00b2) and was followed in magnitude by those of the mallard (2.1 pairs/km\u00b2), the gadwall (1.8 pairs/km\u00b2), the northern pintail (0.8 pairs/km\u00b2), and the redhead (0.8 pairs/km\u00b2). Duck density was consistently highest on service-owned land. The decline of breeding-population sizes in 1987-90 closely corresponded to losses of pond numbers and pond area. The density of breeding pairs per pond was inversely related to pond density, suggesting that breeding ducks tended to concentrate on the remaining ponds as drought intensified. The production of recruits followed the same pattern as breeding-population sizes. We estimated that 2.5% of the ducklings hatched on service-owned land, which was 1.3% of the study area; 19.6% hatched on service easements, which were 14.2% of the study area; and 77.9% hatched on private land, which was 84.6% of the study area.

Estimates of the total area of the Dismal Swamp prior to colonization have varied. The Swamp is bounded on the west by the Suffolk scarp, on the east by the Deep Creek swale, on the north by an indistinct boundary on the Churchland flat and on the south by a transition zone surrounding the mouth of the Pasquotank River basin. The cultural history of the Great Dismal Swamp is rich and varied. Prior to European colonization, the Paleo and Archaic Indians occupied the swamp and its surrounding uplands. One of the most significant concentrations of Archaic Indian artifacts in North America dating from 7,500 to 2500 years B.P. is found along the Suffolk scarp near the western edge of the swamp. The Great Dismal Swamp contains a great variety of plant communities.  Today the Dismal Swamp supports seven major vegetational communities: Atlantic white cedar, pine, cypress-gum, mesic oak and poplar,    evergreen shrub and the everpresent maple-sweetgum. Maple, sweetgum and black gum are present in almost every acre of the swamp in varying amounts from completely dominant to barely represented.

Completing this project will contribute to the completion of a high priorityrecovery task needed to prevent the extinction of the DGF. This project has high potential to prevent extinction by expanding the available habitat for the species and increasing the limited number of breeding sites for this endangered frog. The use of a landscape-scale approach for the conservation of pond-breeding amphibians is critical due to the susceptibility of small isolated populations to extinction (Marsh 2008, Heard et al. 2012). As part of our recovery efforts for the DGF, and in partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP), the USFWS has translocated DGFs to a pond at a TNC site previously unoccupied by the species and within the approved acquisition boundary of the MSCNWR. Subsequently, several DGF breeding events have been documented there. The objective of the proposed project is to expand DGF breeding habitat beyond the pond at TNC to include a suite of ponds that occur on MSCNWR and then translocate frogs to these additional ponds. Accomplishing this objective will require restoring three ponds on MSCNWR, which are in close proximity to the TNC pond, and improving the upland habitat surrounding them. We will restore the ponds by removing hardwoods and using equipment to reshape them in order to attain the proper depth and contour to support the appropriate hydrology. We will improve the adjacent uplands by reducing the density of pines to create more open habitat and conducting prescribed burns. After the habitat work has been successfully completed, DGF tadpoles will be head-started at the site and the resulting metamorphic frogs will be released at the three ponds. The ponds will be monitored for calling male frogs by the use of automated recorders. A drift fence will be constructed around one of the three restored ponds to initiate monitoring of the newly translocated population; monitoring will continue beyond the period of performance of this project."

Studies completed at Stewart Lake Waterfowl Management Area, lower Ashley Creek, Ouray National Wildlife Refuge, and Pariette Wetlands identified several areas where selenium was adversely affecting water quality and creating a hazard to wildlife. The source of contamination at Stewart Lake is drainwater and shallow ground water from soils derived from Mancos Shale. Median selenium concentrations in all drainwater discharged to Stewart Lake exceeded the State standard of 5 micrograms per liter established for wildlife protection. Selenium concentrations in all biological tissues sampled at Stewart Lake Waterfowl Management Area were large compared to concentrations in biota from most other sites in the middle Green River basin.  Selenium concentrations in Ashley Creek upstream of the city of Vernal generally were less than 1 microgram per liter but 12 miles downstream averaged 73 micrograms per liter. The source of the contamination was believed to be from inflows of shallow ground water and surface water originating as seepage from a sewage-lagoon system that flows through Mancos Shale and mobilizes selenium. Waterfowl from the area contained selenium concentrations as large as 27.2 micrograms per gram in muscle tissue, and an eared grebe egg contained 71 micrograms per gram.  Selenium contamination of ponds at Ouray National Wildlife Refuge was limited to a small area on the western part of the refuge and was due to seepage of shallow ground water into waterfowl ponds. Geometric mean concentrations in plants, invertebrates, bird eggs, and fish from the North and South Roadside Ponds were larger than concentrations known to cause reproductive failure in mallards (Anas platyrhyncos). Mallards exposed during a field experiment at the Roadside Ponds quickly accumulated selenium in body tissues and died by the fourth week.  Water-quality deterioration in Pariette Wetlands was believed to be due to the discharge of tailwater and accrual of ground water into the area. Selenium concentrations in biota from Pariette Wetlands ranged from near background to levels known to have adverse effects."

Recently, the Union Camp Corporation donated this large parcel of swamp wilderness to the Nature Conservancy, which will turn it over to the U.S. Department of the Interior. There are approximately 300,000 acres remaining of this last great wilderness area along the Coastal Plain of the Middle Atlantic states. The list of plants in this report is not complete, but it certainly contains most of the species of trees, shrubs, and vines of the Swamp, including some mention of various herbaceous plants. The plant community at this latitude that presents the sharpest contrast with the more northerly woods is the pocosin, bay, or broad-leaved evergreen shrub bog. This combination of broad-leaved evergreens, bays, and pond pines does not occur north of the Dismal Swamp as a major plant community. Such areas in the Dismal Swamp are known as \"lights.\" In the north Jericho Ditch section of the Swamp, in the spring of 1968, I came across two of the rarest plants in southeastern Virginia: the wild or silky camellia and the dwarf trillium. The Great Dismal Swamp area is also the northern outpost for numerous ocher southern plants and for a number of animals, including the cottonmouth moccasin, canebrake rattler, chameleon or green anole, little grass frog ( tiniest North American frog ), squirrel treefrog, southern toad, yellow-bellied turtle, cotton mouse, marsh rabbit, Wayne's black-throated green warbler, and Florida grackle. Nowhere else at this latitude in eastern North America is there such an accumulation of diverse southern forms, and more of them occur in the Swamp than in the surrounding area. Since the Dismal Swamp is mostly solid forest, it is essentially a songbird    swamp. There are about 84 species of breeding birds in the Swamp. Present are the Swainson's Warbler. The Wayne's and yellow-throated warblers and the yellow-throated vireo are the so-called treetop birds of the swamp forest, usually ranging between 40 and 80 feet up.

Lake Drummond, approximately 4 km in diameter, is almost centrally    located within the swamp, which slopes gently to east and south. The flora of the Great Dismal Swamp includes individual species and plant assemblages otherwise scattered widely to the north and south along the Coastal Plain . The canopy and subcanopy consist of mixed evergreen and deciduous, broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees, and there are a variety of evergreen and deciduous shrubs and vines. Anthropogenic disturbance of the natural vegetation has resulted in a wide diversity of wildlife habitats."

                "text": "Trace elements and petroleum hydrocarbons in the aquatic bird food chain of process water evaporation ponds at the Little America Refinery, Casper, Wyoming This study determined the nature and extent of trace elements, metals, and petroleum hydrocarbons in evaporation ponds used for the disposal of process water from Sinclair Oil Corporation\u2019s LARCO oil refinery in Evansville, Wyoming. This study was conducted to determine if contaminants are causing adverse effects or have the potential to adversely affect aquatic migratory birds inhabiting the evaporation ponds. The discharge of refinery process water into relict dune basins created a series of ponds that provide habitat for 39 species of aquatic migratory birds. Several aquatic bird species nest at the evaporation ponds and the adjacent natural marsh complex. Migrating waterfowl and shorebirds also use the ponds as a stop-over with peak numbers (between 1,000 and 2,000 birds) occurring in mid-September during the fall migration. The refinery evaporation ponds are highly eutrophic and contain elevated concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc in bottom sediments. Sediments from the nearby Russian Olive Pond contained elevated concentrations of arsenic, chromium, mercury and nickel. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also present in high concentrations in sediments from the three evaporation ponds. Although these trace elements and PAHs are elevated in the bottom sediments, eutrophication is likely limiting the availability of these contaminants to the food chain and aquatic migratory birds. Some trace elements such as selenium are accumulating in the food chain and PAHs are present in algae and aquatic invertebrates. Selenium bioaccumulation was documented in aquatic birds nesting at the ponds. Selenium concentrations in black-necked stilt eggs (mean = 13.6 \u00ecg/g) exceeded the 6 to 7 \u00ecg/g threshold associated with impaired egg hatchability in black-necked stilts. Selenium concentrations in livers from prefledged juvenile American avocets (mean = 13.8 \u00ecg/g) and blue-winged teal (mean = 20.1 \u00ecg/g) exceeded background for avian livers of 10 \u00ecg/g level. Other species of waterfowl, such as widgeon, gadwall, and Northern shoveler, feeding on algae and aquatic invertebrates in the evaporation ponds are probably also bioaccumulating selenium at levels of concern. PAH bile metabolites and analysis of the liver detoxification enzyme ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) shows that aquatic birds feeding in the evaporation ponds are exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons; however, it is not known if this exposure is resulting in adverse effects. The eutrophic nature of these ponds is precluding the establishment of macrophytic aquatic vegetation as well as limiting the density and diversity of aquatic invertebrates, both dietary items consumed by aquatic migratory birds. Eutrophication and its contribution of organic matter onto the surficial sediments is likely limiting the bioavailability of trace elements and petroleum hydrocarbons as these contaminants are strongly bound to the organic matter within the sediment. Although eutrophication is limiting the availability of chemical contaminants in the food chain, the potential exists for the presence of cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria in the evaporation ponds."

Historically growth, condition, and survival of razorback suckers have been variable between ponds. Because of elevated selenium concentrations previously found in many Grand Valley ponds and wetlands, we had concerns of elevated selenium in grow-out ponds. The purpose of this study was to describe water quality conditions and food supplies in 16 grow-out ponds in western Colorado that are currently being used by the CRRP to propagate juvenile endangered razorback suckers, and to identify any water quality parameters which may limit growth, condition, and survival of razorback suckers in both the grow-out ponds and after stocking into the Colorado and Gunnison rivers. Selenium was the trace element of greatest concern, and toxicity guidelines were exceeded in water, sediment, dietary items, and razorback sucker muscle plugs from several ponds (most notably Maggio and Clymers ponds), indicating increased risk of reproductive impairment (Lemly 1996). Stocked razorback suckers recaptured from the rivers at least 8 months post-stocking still retained high selenium tissue residues acquired from the grow-out ponds. River-stocked razorback suckers had significantly higher selenium concentrations than native bluehead suckers (Catostomus discobolus) and native flannelmouth suckers (Catostomus latipinnis) collected in the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers in the Grand Valley. The levels of selenium we found in razorback suckers are likely reproductively problematic (Lemly 1996). Management recommendations for grow-out ponds are presented to improve survival and condition of razorback suckers."

A bi-monthly census of salinities and bird numbers was taken to determine if there was a correlation between the bird use and salinity of salt evaporation ponds near East Palo Alto. The study was conducted on four salt evaporation ponds in San Mateo County, from June 1978 through June 1979. Salinity readings were taken from each pond, and the total number of birds per pond was counted. The salinities ranged from a low of 50 parts/1,000 in Pond I to a high of 270 parts/1,000 in Pond IV. Thirty-six species were identified and a total of 49,857 birds were counted. Shorebirds, waterfowl, and gulls were the most common species using the salt ponds.  The surface-feeding ducks and the phalaropes exhibited a preference for Pond I which had the lowest average salinity reading of the four ponds studies. The shorebirds, diving ducks, and gulls all showed a high degree of salinity tolerance and were found on all ponds. The shorebirds made the heaviest use of ponds which were sufficiently shallow for wading regardless of salinities, thus showing a possible food foraging preference."

At 4,400 km2 (1,700 mi2), the GSL is the 4th largest natural water body west of the Mississipi River and the largest saline lake in the continental United States. The GSL supports hemispherically significant numbers (measured in percent of global population) of a number of bird species including Wilson\u2019s phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), black-necked stilt (Hymantopus mexicanus), snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and others. We assessed important avian habitats on the lake including freshwater and estuarine \u201ctransitional\u201d wetlands on the GSL\u2019s southern and eastern shores, and the open waters of the lake. Trace metals and organic constituents were measured in over 600 samples of sediments, invertebrates, fish and avian eggs; biomarkers of exposure and/or effect (acetylcholinesterase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase enzymes, endocrine hormones 17\u00e2-estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites) were measured in fish as well. In the open waters of the lake, investigation focused on sediments, brine shrimp, and liver tissue from eared grebes, which forage on the lake in the fall and winter as part of a protracted migratory stop-over where they use the lake to undergo a complete feather molt and replacement. Results of this investigation indicated that in general while a number of anthropogenically generated constituents could be observed in sediments and biota around the GSL, there were only a few locations where these constituents were present at levels of concern for the health or management of migratory bird populations. Biomarker data did not indicate that there were any consistent trends in exposure to constituents associated with the biomarkers in fish. Follow-up studies were performed in 1999 and 2000 in areas where data indicated that birds might be exposed to elevated contaminant concentrations. These included an investigation of elevated mercury concentrations in eggs of birds and contaminated sediments at the outfall of an industrial/irrigation canal in southern Farmington Bay, and sediments contaminated with metals associated with mining on the south shoreline of the GSL. These investigations concluded that sediment-foraging birds using a localized area of southern Farmington Bay may be exposed to concentrations of mercury and other contaminants that could cause adverse effects (e.g., impacts to growth, reproduction and/or survival), and that there were localized areas of elevated selenium exposure, associated with the operations and past waste management practices of a large copper smelting facility located on the south shore of the GSL. Data collected during this study also supported a hypothesis that mercury, possibly originating from atmospheric deposition, was being captured by biota within the open waters of the lake where it could be bioaccumulated by birds that use the lake as migratory stop-over habitat. Findings from this study have been used since their collection to inform additional efforts to manage and improve avian and other wildlife habitat on the GSL, including the establishment of a site-specific water quality standard for selenium in the wetlands and open waters of the GSL; and further investigation of the origin, bioavailability and effects of mercury exposure to birds in the GSL ecosystem."

The evaluation provides descriptive analysis of trends, pre-post comparisons, and statistics from a single time period, complemented by qualitative analysis. The exposure period is a minimum of four years.  Key findings include:  Improved Service Delivery Platform    *Crucial health infrastructure was built or rehabilitated and equipped for use, including 138 health centers (HCs) and 14 outpatient departments (OPDs), though with significant delays and required substantial complementary investment from the Government of Lesotho.     Consensus suggests that the Project provided a necessary platform for health service delivery throughout the country. However, many new HCs lack sufficient space to meet increasing demand, and concerns about the quality of construction and equipment persist. National Reference Lab and Blood Transfusion Services have increased their operations, though budgetary factors constrain their full service expansion.  Patient and Staff Perceptions    Patient satisfaction with and use of the facilities has increased, though barriers still exist for pregnant women and people in peripheral communities.  Staff levels and satisfaction with their living and working conditions have improved. Yet budget constraints keep more than a quarter of sampled health facilities staffed below the current five-nurse staffing complement, especially in hard-to-reach areas.  Progress toward Health Outcomes    Findings indicate that most population-level health outcomes will require more time to materialize, contrary to MCC's expectations at the outset, though trends in health care use and improvements in some health-related indicators are encouraging."

Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa /APSE by two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.    Insect sources and rearing conditions    Aphelinus glycinis was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect Aphis craccivora or Acyrthosiphon pisum because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.    Aphis craccivora is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Acyrthosiphon pisum is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Aphis craccivora in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and Ac. pisum were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, Vicia faba L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in H. defensa in Ac. pisum and APSE type 4 was found in H. defensa in Ap. craccivora. Aphid lines without H. defensa were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on V. fava plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of H. defensa from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from Ap. craccivora and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from Ac. craccivora were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of H. defensa and APSE prior to assays.    Aphelinus atriplicis was collected as mummified Diuraphis noxia on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; A. glycinis was collected as mummified Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. Aphelinus glycinis was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); A. atriplicis was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the Aphelinus varipes complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. Aphelinus atriplicis was reared on D. noxia on barley, Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae); Aphelinus glycinis was reared on Aphis glycines on soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of A. glycines was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither D. noxia nor A. glycines are known to harbor H. defensa, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of H. defensa in our colonies of these species. Although A. glycines harbors another bacterium, Arsenophonus, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.    Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with Hamiltonella defensa versus uninfected aphids    To measure the effect of infection with H. defensa harboring APSE on parasitism of Ap. craccivora and Ac. craccivora, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of Aphelinus atriplicis or Aphelinus glycinis that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with H. defensa or uninfected aphids on V. faba variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. Aphelinus females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.    The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.    Aphids parasitized by these Aphelinus species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.    Design structure    The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for Aphelinus glycinis on Ap. craccivora and Aphelinus atriplicis on Ap. craccivora and on Ac. pisum (24 each for Hamiltonella-infected versus uninfected aphids)."

EEDSM beneficiaries include the entire population with access to electricity, an estimated 4.3 million households with 19.6 million people. The EEDSM Project consists of four activities: the Development and Enforcement of Standards and Labels activity, the Improved Energy Auditing activity, the Education and Public Information activity, and the Demand Side Management activity.   The evaluation of the EEDSM project will address the following questions for each of the four interventions designed to reduce energy waste and increase the reserve margin between electricity supply and peak demand. These interventions include (1) a rollout of energy efficiency standards, (2) implementation of the pre-tertiary school curriculum and public information on use of efficient appliances with standards and labels via different media platforms, (3) implementation of an energy auditing and retrofitting activity and an intervention to establish two sustainable energy services centers (SESCs) that will train and certify energy auditors for the country, and (4) installing energy-efficient LED street lights. The methodological approach for the performance evaluation of EEDSM relies in tracking key outcomes over time, qualitative data analysis, pre-post analysis, and simulations. The impact evaluation will assess the impact of the R2R&R intervention on the electricity consumption. We will measure impacts relative to the pre-treatment period using an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) method which involves comparing outcomes before an intervention is implemented with those after. The sample for the analysis of outcomes from administrative utility data will include the intervention buildings.   Evaluation questions include: 1. Have the EEDSM interventions changed consumption of electricity by individual customers? 2. Did the availability and purchases of more energy-efficient appliances increase when standards were implemented? To what extent can these changes be attributed to the new standards? 3. To what extent has the R2R&R intervention affected electricity use and bill payment rates? 4. Were project activities implemented as designed? How did implementation (in terms of objectives, activities, and beneficiaries) deviate from the original logic driving the investment, and why? How did changes in implementation affect project performance? What were the implementation successes and challenges? 5. Were improvements in project outcomes sustained after the end of the compact? What sustainability planning was done during implementation, and why? What are the critical institutional factors that affected their sustainability?"

Refuges are also places where compatible human contact with nature is encouraged. In keeping with this national direction, Parker River National Wildlife Refuge has served both wildlife and people since its establishment in 1942. In its coastal barrier island-salt marsh location along major bird migration routes, the refuge is used by over 300 species of birds. Parker River's extensive salt marshes serve as important feeding and resting areas for peak concentrations of up to 25,000 ducks and 6,000 geese during fall and spring migrations. In addition, the refuge provides habitat for large flocks of warblers and shorebirds, and refuge wetlands are valued as a nursery for fish and shellfish. Over 400,000 people visit Parker River NWR each year. The natural beauty of unspoiled beach and dune, expansive salt marsh, and sparkling water offers visitors respite from the bustle of surrounding urbanization including the developed northern end of Plum Island. The combination of natural and man-altered habitat \u2014 salt marsh, saltpans, brush, freshwater pools, and fields \u2014 makes the refuge an outstanding area for wildlife observation. In addition to bird watching and environmental education, visitor activities include surf fishing, hiking, clamming, plum and cranberry picking, and hunting. In view of its two-fold mission, Parker River\u2019s central management challenge is to protect its wildlife and natural character while providing an increasing number of visitors with quality recreational, educational, and interpretive experiences. In 1980 a nine-step comprehensive planning process and extensive public involvement effort to document long-range management and development goals for Parker River was initiated. The planning process was accomplished through the cooperation of a Fish and Wildlife Service team of refuge planners, wildlife managers, landscape architects, biologists, resource specialists, computer mapping specialists, and cartographers. The resulting Technical Report describes management measures necessary to retain the natural, wildlife, and human values associated with the refuge. Specifically, this report includes: (1). Background information about the refuge, its management, and the planning process. (2). A summary statement of policy direction and planning issues. (3).

In this paper I examine foraging behavior of Piping Plover to determine factors that affect the time plovers devote to foraging. Objectives of the study were to determine: (1) where Piping Plovers foraged, (2) time devoted to foraging as a function of nesting beach, reproductive stage and brood size, and (3) the effect of human activities on foraging time. Piping Plovers are ideal for such an examination because they nest solitarily on barrier beach islands that have suffered from increased human development and recreational activities. I examined foraging behavior because clutch size) and nest sites do not seem to be causing population declines. Thus I wanted to determine whether Piping Plover experienced difficulties foraging because of people. Reproductive success is lower in areas with high human disturbance. Foraging behavior of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) was studied using a focal animal approach from 1985-1986. Time devoted to foraging decreased as vigilance (time devoted to being alert) increased. Variations in vigilance were explained by beach, reproductive stage, brood size, time of day, and number of people nearby. Overall, Piping Plovers foraged from 46-79 sec., were alert for 14-57 sec., and displayed or ran from people for 1-8 sec. in the 2 min. samples. Plovers at sites less disturbed by people (Little Beach, Holgate) generally devoted more time to foraging and less time to vigilance than birds at the other sites. Time devoted to foraging was generally higher In May, lower in June, and increased again in July. Plovers that were incubating or caring for chicks spent less time foraging than those that had lost their chicks. Chicks spent less time foraging and more time being alert, running, and crouching than did their parents foraging during the same time periods. With increasing brood size, chicks spent less time foraging and more time running or crouching although the number of people nearby did not vary. Behavior was correlated within members of a pair: birds spent less time foraging as their mates increased time devoted to alertness, being off the nest, or displaying. When brooding birds increased alert time, their mates increased their alertness and displaying, and decreased foraging time. As the number of people near foraging plovers increased, time devoted to running and crouching increased and time devoted to feeding decreased. It appears that the presence of people is stressful for breeding adults and chicks, forcing them to spend significantly less time foraging, perhaps accounting for decreased overall reproductive success."

Because of the extent of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and significant contamination of some areas, CAP reports for this Refuge cover units, subunits, or individual islands within the Refuge. This report documents known and potential contaminant issues on the Bering Sea Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Most people regard National Wildlife Refuges as pristine areas reserved for wildlife and fish. This unit of the Refuge includes biologically important remote islands whose coastal cliffs provide nesting habitat for millions of seabirds. Although managing these species is a primary management goal, the Refuge has, and continues to experience, a variety of other uses. These uses of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge- Bering Sea Unit have included government agency and military use, commercial fisheries, and limited recreational use. These activities can result in contamination of trust resources and their habitats that require cleanup and remediation. Some former governmental activities left facilities and other remains on-site after operations ceased, often due to costs of materials removal, transport, and cleanup. At some sites, hazardous materials were spilled with no subsequent or inadequate cleanup. These concerns have been identified and highlighted in this CAP report. Cleanup of some of these sites is or has been conducted. Post-closure sampling conducted by others should be reviewed if there are sites that pose a potential continued risk to Refuge lands or resources. This Refuge unit has several contaminant issues that are highlighted in this report. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operated numerous facilities on the Pribilof Islands, many of which had petroleum contamination problems. Most of these sites have undergone extensive cleanup actions. St. Matthew Island has Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) that need additional site assessment. In addition, oil spills have had adverse effects on seabirds and their habitats throughout the Bering Sea Unit, and these spill risks are anticipated    to likely increase in the future, should shipping and resource development increase as the result of continued climate change. Climate change could also cause unanticipated changes in contaminant bioavailability. If and when any potentially contaminated lands are considered for conveyance to the Refuge, a full contaminant preacquisition assessment is required by existing Service and Department of the Interior policies. When warranted, preacquisition assessments should include rigorous sampling by (or funded by) the transferring land managers before the Service accepts any of these properties. Because of the potential for future oil spills both from vessels and land-based fuel storage facilities, spill response preparedness through spill contingency planning and participation in spill exercises is one way for the Refuge to prepare for such potentially damaging event. Collection of adequate baseline data prior to spill events is important for damage assessment efforts when spill incidents occur that affect Service trust resources. Baseline data will also be important to document present conditions as climate change progresses with its potential to complicate contaminant effects."

In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to characterizing clique tree growth as a function of increasing Bayesian network connectedness, specifically: (i) the expected number of moral edges in their moral graphs or (ii) the ratio of the number of non-root nodes to the number of root nodes.  In experiments, we systematically increase the connectivity of bipartite Bayesian networks, and find that clique tree size growth is well-approximated by Gompertz growth curves.  This research improves the understanding of the scaling behavior of clique tree clustering, provides a foundation for benchmarking and developing improved BN inference algorithms, and presents an aid for analytical trade-off studies of tree clustering using growth curves.

Insofar as we were not able to randomly assign upgraded equipment across schools or trades, we could not estimate the impact of exposure to equipment upgrades directly. However, the gradual rollout of equipment upgrades to TVET schools over time implied that individuals in later cohorts studying trades affected by equipment upgrades were exposed to these upgrades for longer than individuals in earlier cohorts. Taking advantage of this gradual rollout, we proceeded to estimate the impact of exposure to upgraded equipment in three steps: First, we randomly assigned applicants to trades in 10 TVET schools that were generally oversubscribed, receiving more applicants than they could accommodate each year. This enabled us to estimate the causal impact of admission to trades affected by equipment upgrades for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 admission cohorts. Then we compared the impact of admission to trades affected by upgrades on outcomes in earlier and later cohorts to estimate the impact of exposure to upgrades.  The random assignment of applicants to trades in 10 TVET schools also enables us to evaluate the impact of admission to a TVET school which is important for assessing the value of technical and vocational education in Mongolia. Therefore, this evaluation is focused both on the impact of exposure to equipment upgrades and the impact of admission to a TVET school.   Findings    We find that admission to oversubscribed TVET schools leads to significant improvements in employment and earnings, especially for women. These improvements are likely due to the acquisition of more skills in specific trades, greater work intensity, and increased employment opportunities in high-paying sectors. These findings are consistent with the presence of a shortage of vocational students in Mongolia--one of the key assumptions underpinning the choice of the TVET sector as a focus of the Mongolia Compact. Moreover, they suggest that expanding access to TVET schools would have large benefits for prospective students, and for women in particular.  We do not find evidence for positive impacts of exposure to upgraded equipment on employment or earnings. There is also no evidence for impacts on intermediate or other outcomes. Why do we not find positive impacts from exposure to upgraded equipment? One possible explanation is that labor market opportunities for those who studied upgraded or improved trades deteriorated relative to those who studied other trades. Indeed, there is some evidence for a general deterioration of labor market opportunities for individuals admitted to TVET schools in the 2012 cohort. Unfortunately, since we were not able to randomly assign upgraded equipment across schools or trades, we cannot rule out these alternative explanations for the absence of positive impacts. Future evaluations should heed the challenges inherent in research designs that do not rely solely on random assignment."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Information on the grazing patterns of the ponies was obtained by observing the ponies in the field during over 600 hours of observation over the course of one year. By recording the type of plant being consumed and the habitat in which the ponies were feeding, it was determined that on a yearly basis the animals spend over 60% of the time in the salt marsh. Grass areas, vegetated primarily with American Beach grass, were utilized about 20% of the time, while other habitats such as forest, brush, and sand areas were little utilized. The effects of pony grazing were studied by marking areas grazed by ponies then re-examining these areas at a later time. Although the grazed plants displayed shorter stems than ungrazed plants, they showed a slightly larger number of sterns per plant. Likewise the grazed plants grew more in the period between grazing and re-examination than did ungrazed plants. These results suggest that light grazing  activity may actually stimulate additional plant growth and lead to a shorter but more dense vegetation.     Information on the density of the vegetation in the study area was obtained by running transects at 0.5 mile intervals along the island. Results showed that salt marshes contained 9 times the amount of vegetation as an area of comparable size in the dune and inner-dune grassy areas. Since the number of grazed plants and stems were recorded, it was determined that only about 1.5% of all plants and 1% of all stems were grazed in grassy areas while 9.5% of the plants and 3.2% of the stems were grazed in salt marshes. This data suggested that about 11% of the available vegetation had been grazed."

                "text": "Indonesia - Green Prosperity: Community-Based Off-Grid Renewable Energy Grant Portfolio Taken as a whole, this evaluation aims, to the extent possible, to validate the program logic underlying the portfolio of community-based off-grid renewable energy grants in the Green Prosperity Grant Facility, doing so through a focused investigation of two specific grants: W3A Akuo Energy Solar/Micro-Hydro, Berau and W3A Anekatek Solar, East Sumba. It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

Shorebirds respond to cues on their overwintering grounds to initiate long migrations to nesting sites throughout the Arctic. Climate-driven changes in snowmelt and temperature, which drive invertebrate emergence, may lead to a lack of synchrony between the timing of shorebird nesting and the availability of invertebrate prey essential for egg formation and subsequent chick survival. We modeled the biomass of invertebrates captured in modified Malaise traps as a function of accumulated temperature and weather variables for eight North American research camps in the Arctic Shorebird Demographic Network over the years 2010-2012. Models were based on data from the closest weather station and used to hindcast invertebrate biomass for the last ~60 years. From the hindcasted invertebrate data we calculated three measures of invertebrate phenology: the first day with invertebrate biomass above 10 mg; the number of days in May, June, and July with invertebrate biomass above 10 mg; and the date of peak invertebrate biomass. The 10-mg threshold was based on literature indicating it provided sufficient daily prey biomass to support normal shorebird chick growth. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis using 5, 15, and 20 mg showed that our results were robust to variation in this threshold. Each response was regressed against year to investigate changes over time. Changes in hindcasted invertebrate phenology were most conspicuous at the northernmost camps and were on the order of 1 to 3 days per decade. At Barrow, Ikpikpuk, and MacKenzie Delta, the timing of the first day with invertebrate biomass above 10 mg has advanced by 2 to 2.5 days per decade. At Barrow and Ikpikpuk, the number of days with invertebrate biomass above 10 mg has increased by 1.5 to 2 days per decade. The timing of peak invertebrate biomass has advanced at Ikpikpuk and Cape Krusenstern by 1 to 1.5 days per decade. Although our results suggest that seasonal prey availability for arctic shorebirds is advancing, the potential for trophic mismatch is most likely at the northernmost sites we evaluated, although it may be mitigated by similar advances in shorebird migration and nesting as reported from other Arctic sites."

It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). Although the grid is from 60S to 60N, the high latitudes (beyond 50S/N) near real-time retrievals are considered very unreliable and thus are screened out from the daily accumulations. The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes.  Counts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.  Efforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format.   The latency of this derived daily product is about 7 hours after the UTC day is closed. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.  The information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.  The following describes the derivation in more details.  The daily accumulation is derived by summing valid retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have         Pdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]    Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}  where:    Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)    Pi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)    Nf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8    1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise    Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.  Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.    Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.  On occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which     Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.  There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:  Perr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]    Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )  where:    Perr_daily  - Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)    Ncnt_err    - The counts for the error variable  Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 3-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:  rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5    (mm/hr)  This estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation."

In the standard global measurement mode, OMI observes 60 ground pixels (13 km x 24 km at nadir) across the swath (13 km x 48 km at nadir). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~60 minutes) and is roughly 200 MB in size. There are approximately 14 orbits per day. Once a month, in one orbit, OMI performs dark measurements, it does not perform radiance measurements. In addition, OMI performs spatial zoom measurements one day per month. For that day, this product also contains UV2 measurements that are rebinned from the spatial zoom-in measurements. In original spatial zoom mode the nadir ground pixel size is 13 x 12 km and measurements are available only for the UV2 and VIS wavelengths (306 to 432 nm).

The OML1BRVG files are stored in the HDF4 based EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). The radiances for the earth measurements (also referred as signal) and its precision are stored as a 16-bit mantissa and an 8-bit exponent.

Nolan and Hitt (2006) developed two national models to predict contamination of ground water by nonpoint sources of nitrate. The nonlinear approach to national-scale Ground-WAter Vulnerability Assessment (GWAVA) uses components representing nitrogen (N) sources, transport, and attenuation. One model (GWAVA-S) predicts nitrate contamination of shallow (typically less than 5 meters deep), recently recharged ground water, which may or may not be used for drinking. The other (GWAVA-DW) predicts ambient nitrate concentration in deeper supplies used for drinking. This data set is one of 14 data sets (1 output data set and 13 input data sets) associated with the GWAVA-DW model. Full details of the model development are in Nolan and Hitt (2006). For inputs to the model, spatial attributes representing 13 nitrogen loading and transport and attenuation factors were compiled as raster data sets (1-km by 1-km grid cell size) for the conterminous United States (see table 1). >Table 1.-- Parameters of nonlinear regression model for > nitrate in ground water used for drinking (GWAVA-DW) > and corresponding input spatial data sets. > [kg, kilograms; km2, square kilometers.] > >Nitrogen Source Factors Data Set Name > 1 farm fertilizer (kg/hectare) gwava-dw_ffer > 2 confined manure (kg/hectare) gwava-dw_conf > 3 orchards/vineyards (percent) gwava-dw_orvi > 4 population density (people/km2) gwava-dw_popd > >Transport to Aquifer Factors > 5 water input (km2/cm) gwava-dw_wtin > 6 glacial till (yes/no) gwava-dw_gtil > 7 semiconsolidated sand aquifers gwava-dw_semc > (yes/no) > 8 sandstone and carbonate rocks gwava-dw_sscb > (yes/no) > 9 drainage ditch (km2) gwava-dw_ddit > 10 Hortonian overland flow gwava-dw_hor > (percent of streamflow) > >Attenuation Factors > 11 fresh surface water withdrawal gwava-dw_swus > for irrigation (megaliters/day) > 12 irrigation tailwater recovery (km2) gwava-dw_twre > 13 Dunne overland flow gwava-dw_dun > (percent of streamflow) > 14 well depth (meters) - \"Farm fertilizer\" is the average annual nitrogen input from commercial fertilizer applied to agricultural lands, 1992-2001, in kilograms per hectare. \"Confined manure\" is the average annual nitrogen input from confined animal manure, 1992 and 1997, in kilograms per hectare. \"Orchards/vineyards\" is the percent of orchards/vineyards land cover classification. \"Population density\" is 1990 block group population density, in people per square kilometer. \"Water input\" is the ratio of the total area of irrigated land to precipitation, in square kilometers per centimeter. \"Glacial till\" is the presence or absence of poorly sorted glacial till east of the Rocky Mountains. \"Semiconsolidated sand aquifers\" is the presence or absence of semiconsolidated sand aquifers. \"Sandstone and carbonate rocks\" is the presence or absence of sandstone and carbonate rock aquifers. \"Drainage ditch\" is the area of National Resources Inventory surface drainage, field ditch conservation practice, in square kilometers. \"Hortonian overland flow\" is infiltration excess overland flow estimated by TOPMODEL, in percent of streamflow. \"Fresh surface water withdrawal for irrigation\" is the amount of fresh surface water withdrawal for irrigation, in megaliters per day. \"Irrigation tailwater recovery\" is the area of National Resources Inventory irrigation system, tailwater recovery conservation practice, in square kilometers. \"Dunne overland flow\" is saturation overland flow estimated by TOPMODEL, in percent of streamflow. \"Well depth\" is the depth of the well, in meters.

Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.  This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  Early Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHE and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL).   In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1\u00b0x0.1\u00b0 (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.  The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.  The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the \u201cforecast\u201d and the IR estimates as the \u201cobservations\u201d, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about \u00b190 minutes away from the overpass time.  The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:  \"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and    \"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing    and once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:  \"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.  Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.  The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.  The daily accumulation is derived by summing valid retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have               Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]    Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}  where:    Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)    Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)    Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48    1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise    Pdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.  Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.    Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.  On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which     Pdaily_cnt less than  Nf.  There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:  Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]    Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )  where:    Perr_daily  - Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)    Ncnt_err    - The counts for the error variable  Thus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:  rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5  (mm/hr)  This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation."

The present treatment plant was designed for an output of 2.00 million gallons per day. During the first nine months of 1973 the    plant output averaged 10% over design. The maximum days were about 75% over design. At the present time the source of the water supply is approaching the level of being unacceptable as a potable water due to the high chloride level and hardness. Public Health Service standards indicate that a potable water should have a chloride    content less than 250 miligrams per litre (250 parts per million). There are three solutions under consideration for increasing the capacity of the supply and treatment facilities to 5 million gallons per day; Plan A, B and Plan C."

Such understanding of geographic patterns can, for instance, help to identify conservation partners and where scale-appropriate land management actions should occur. For instance, in areas with large, contiguous public land ownerships, land managers may be more able to manage coarse-filter ecological processes such as prescribed or managed wildfire to meet ecosystem based goals and objectives. We enhanced prior broad-scale assessments of the National Wildlife Refuge System by providing all refuges in the Great Lakes Biological Network (Network) a higher resolution, ecoregional context for refuge-specific planning and management. We used multiple spatial data sources in a geographic information system (GIS) to depict patterns associated with 14 Network refuges and their 15 broader-scaled ecoregions. Spatial data pertaining to ownership, land cover, and soils were used to assess conditions among ecoregions of the Network and individual refuges. We also conducted analyses of landscape metrics using land cover data at both of these scales. Although more consideration of the observed patterns is warranted and some discrepancies in the data sources were found, preliminary findings indicate that considerable variability exists among ecoregions and refuges in all characteristics studied, although finer-scaled groupings are possible with some refuges (e.g., Shiawassee and Ottawa NWRs; Tamarac-Rice Lake-Necedah-Seney NWRs, etc.). Larger refuges tended to be in ecoregions with more public lands characterized by more natural land covers. In these refuges, we suggest the broad-scale conservation or restoration of natural patterns and processes is possible, with other public agencies comprising the dominant conservation partners. In other refuges in other ecoregions, attempts can be made to mitigate the adverse impacts of non-native land covers on primarily private lands that dominate these ecoregions. Conservation partners of note may be conservancies and other conservation-oriented private entities. The patterns we found indicate that each refuge must be viewed as having its own opportunities and limitations for wildlife habitat conservation and restoration."

The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%).

Qualitative analyses - through key informant interviews and focus group discussions - helped assess the impact of customs processing, as well as port security on truck throughput. In terms of findings, the evaluation determined that the investment in port infrastructure was not sufficient to allow the Cape Verde economy to diversify - through extension of tourism and regional distribution - and create jobs and new businesses. In operational efficiency, the evaluation found that a decrease in dwell time, a decrease in gate and yard congestion; however, container operations and berths were underutilized prior to the intervention and that underutilization continued through the project completion. The evaluation found that the Port became more competitive in terms of capacity, equipment, operations, level of services and costs, and costs of imported and exported goods have decreased and are more competitive with other regional ports; however, Port of Praia has lost market share to Porto Grande for inter-island cabotage trade. Lastly, total volumes of exports from Cape Verde fluctuated, but increased slightly, and exports from Port of Praia changed little over the evaluation period, and Praia has become the primary center for the redistribution of products within the island economy simply because of the concentration of the population there. Also, increased international passenger transit movements beginning 2010 through 2014 suggest increased tourism in the country; however, there was no clear indication that the intervention impacted trade through Port of Praia positively or negatively."

The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model for sediment retention was modified for Hawaii, parameterized, and run for each of the Main Hawaiian Islands to determine sediment export from subwatershed hydrologic units (Falinski et al., in prep). Results from this model were aggregated into larger drainage areas that flow to single coastal pour points. From these points sediment was dispersed offshore using the Kernel Density tool in ArcGIS with a 1.5-km search radius. The resulting raster depicts simplistic sediment plumes with units in tons of sediment per year per hectare.  The InVEST model predicts the average annual amount of sediment (tons/yr) retained in and exported from each map pixel as a function of many landscape variables. Data inputs to InVEST included: 1) USGS 10-m Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 2) NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) land use/land cover data; 3) R factor (old USGS maps and interpolation); 4) K factor (USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO)); 5) University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH) rainfall atlas; 6) ArcHydro-derived subwatersheds such that flow lines approximately match the State of Hawaii streams layer; and 7) derived products from the above and more. See Falinski et al. (in prep) for detailed methodology.  Coastal pour points were created by intersecting streams and coastline features from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), resulting in points where streams flow to the shoreline. The NHD was used rather than flow lines generated from the DEM because there are many instances in Hawaii where streams flow into man-made ditch systems and never reach the coast or simply dry up and go underground before reaching the coast.  To determine the amount of sediment load at the coastline, resulting coastal points were given a unique drainage identifier. Next, the stream segment features were buffered by 1 m and dissolved so that connecting stream networks became single features. These polygon stream features were then assigned the drainage ID from the coastal points using a spatial join and subsequently used to assign that drainage ID to the subwatershed polygons. Finally, subwatersheds were dissolved by drainage ID and sediment export from each subwatershed was summed up to yield the total sediment export for each larger drainage basin, which was then joined back to the corresponding coastal drainage points. Each step in the process required quality control to ensure that: no pour points are left out, subwatersheds are not erroneously connected to the wrong drainage or left out, each drainage has only 1 pour point, and drainages do not erroneously span a ridgeline that should divide basins."

Numerous surveys of wildlife use of Upper Cook Inlet have been conducted during spring however, few have been conducted during summer when waterfowl are rearing young or molting, and when shorebirds have commenced their southward migrations. Upper Cook Inlet contains important habitat resources for many species of migratory birds, marine mammals, and other wildlife. Upper Cook Inlet is also an area of extensive onshore and offshore oil and gas production, commercial and sport fishing, ocean-going transportation, and military activities; and it is a potential area for coal and hardrock mining, hydroelectric power generation, and timber harvest. New infrastructures may be proposed at any time for new oil and gas finds, and for developing and exporting coal, minerals and timber. New infrastructures may be proposed to be located in valuable wildlife habitats. These surveys were conducted to identify and gather preliminary data on valuable wildlife habitats."

Orthophotos, raw imagery, and scanned aerial photos are common files held here.  Two sets of digital orthophoto mosaics, leaf-on (fall) and leaf-off (spring), were created for Colonial National Historical Park. To achieve manageable file sizes, each set is made up of five files that, together, cover the entire geographic extent of the park. Kucera International acquired color infrared, stereo pair 1:6,000 scale aerial photography for the leaf-on mosaics on October 26, 2001 and, for the leaf-off mosaics on March 1, 2002. The photography was delivered to the National Park Service (NPS), quality checked, accepted as provided, and sent to NCSU-CEO. Upon receipt at NCSU-CEO, the air photos were counted to make sure that none were missing, scanned and saved in .tif format, and placed in the air photo archive maintained at NCSU-CEO for the NPS Northeast Region Inventory and Monitoring Program. Associated data and information provided by Kucera International, and also stored in the air photo archive, include the airborne global positioning system (GPS) and inertial mapping unit (IMU) data files, the camera calibration certificates for the cameras, and the hardcopy flight reports for the photography that crosswalk the airborne GPS and IMU data to the photo frame numbers.  The leaf-on and leaf-off mosaics were produced from 328 and 280 color infrared air photos, respectively, scanned at 600 dpi with 24-bit color depth. For each of the ten mosaics (five leaf-on and five leaf-off), scanned .tif images of the relevant air photos were imported into ERDAS Imagine (.img) format where a photo block was created using airborne GPS and IMU data that Kucera International supplied with the aerial photography. Each photo block was manipulated until it could be triangulated with a root mean square error of less than 1. At this point, single frame orthophotos (one for each air photo) were generated within Imagine and exported to Imagine .lan format. Then the .lan files were imported into ER Mapper\u2019s native (.ers) format, and an ER Mapper algorithm was created which contains the color balancing information and the cutlines created for each of the final mosaics. In ER Mapper, band interleaved by line (.bil) image and header files for each mosaic were generated, the .bil images were imported into Imagine .img format, and, finally, the .img images were compressed using MrSID software with a 20:1 compression ratio. The final mosaics, in both .img and MrSID formats, are stored in the NCSU-CEO data archive."

Guam National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is situated on the North end of the island surrounded by two military bases, one of which is a major port of entry for the planned import and export of people and materials. In turn these activities will place Guam NWR at higher risk of invasion by new pest species. The refuge would therefore like to start a vegetation and insect early detection monitoring program. In addition to the early detection monitoring the refuge would also like to concentrate on control and restoration of a section of beach strand with invasivevegetation (Leucaena leucocephala). This will enhance the section of the Refuge open to the public. All aspects of this project will involve participation by volunteers, from pulling invasive plants to collecting and training to identify insects and vegetation."

Determining whether the eroded sediment is exported to the deep ocean or imported via tidal channels and deposited on the marsh platform is critical to understanding the long-term response of the marsh to wave attack and sea-level rise. Quantifying water-column sediment flux helps to characterize the role of tidal channels in this process, and water discharge is a key component of sediment flux. To that end, discharge was measured repeatedly over consecutive diurnal tidal cycles in the tidal channels of Bayou Heron and Bayou Middle, within Grand Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Mississippi on January 24\u00e2\u0080\u009328, 2017. These data were collected by using a Teledyne RDI Rio Grande 1200-kilohertz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP).

In 1934, Federal legislation (Executive Order 6924) established MNWR to    benefit wintering waterfowl and other migratory bird species. On an annual basis, the refuge staff decide how to manage 14 impoundments to benefit not only waterfowl during the nonbreeding season, but also shorebirds during fall and spring migration. In making these decisions, the challenge is to select a portfolio, or collection, of management actions for the impoundments that optimizes use by the three groups of birds while respecting budget constraints. In this study, a decision support tool was developed for these annual management decisions.  Within the decision framework, there are three different management objectives: shorebird-use days during fall    and spring migrations, and waterfowl-use days during the nonbreeding season. Sixteen potential management actions    were identified for impoundments; each action represents a combination of hydroperiod and vegetation manipulation.    Example hydroperiods include semi-permanent and seasonal drawdowns, and vegetation manipulations include mechanicalchemical treatment, burning, disking, and no action. Expert elicitation was used to build a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model that predicts shorebird- and waterfowl-use days for each potential management action. The BBN was parameterized for a representative impoundment, MI-9, and predictions were re-scaled for this impoundment to predict outcomes at other impoundments on the basis of size. Parameter estimates in the BBN model can be updated using observations from ongoing monitoring that is part of the Integrated Waterbird Management and Monitoring (IWMM) program.   The optimal portfolio of management actions depends on the importance, that is, weights, assigned to the three objectives, as well as the budget. Five scenarios with a variety of objective weights and budgets were developed. Given the 1  U.S. Geological Survey. 2  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. large number of possible portfolios (1614), a heuristic genetic algorithm was used to identify a management action portfolio that maximized use-day objectives while respecting budget constraints. The genetic algorithm identified a portfolio of management actions for each of the five scenarios, enabling refuge staff to explore the sensitivity of their management decisions to objective weights and budget constraints.  The decision framework developed here provides a transparent, defensible, and testable foundation for decision making at MNWR. The BBN model explicitly structures and parameterizes a mental model previously used by an expert to assign management actions to the impoundments. With ongoing IWMM monitoring, predictions from the model can be tested, and model parameters updated, to reflect empirical observations. This framework is intended to be a living document that can be updated to reflect changes in the decision context (for example, new objectives or constraints, or new models to compete with the current BBN model). Rather than a mandate support tool; tool outputs can become part of the deliberations of refuge staff when making difficult management decisions for multiple objectives."

This dataset contains estimates of the total month-by-month geopotential of the Earth, derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission measurements, produced by the Center for Space Research (CSR) at University of Texas at Austin. The data are provided in spherical harmonic coefficients, averaged over approximately a month. The primary objective of the GRACE-FO mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field and corresponding Earth mass change variations, such as from polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers; total water storage on land (from groundwater changes in deep aquifers to changes in soil moisture and surface water); changes in deep ocean currents; and changes within the solid Earth itself, such as postglacial rebound and the impact of major earthquakes. This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 490 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 220+/-50 km apart, using a microwave ranging system. In addition to these inter-satellite range changes, the non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite are measured using a high accuracy electrostatic accelerometer. The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using star cameras (with three heads per satellite) and a GPS receiver. Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field perturb the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently. These differences lead to minute changes (on the order of tens of micrometers per second) in the distance between the spacecraft as they orbit the Earth. This change in distance (or range rate) is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft. The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals. The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements. This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the geopotential coefficients of an Earth gravity field model, typically on a per-month basis."

The issue is particularly important in Arctic Ocean waters since rapid warming there increases the likelihood that gas hydrate--an ice-like form of methane and water stable at particular pressure and temperature conditions within marine sediments--will break down and release its methane to the overlying ocean. Some researchers have even proposed the possibility of an Arctic methane catastrophe characterized by wholesale breakdown of gas hydrates in marine sediments and release of the methane to the atmosphere as climate warms. This dataset collected on the West Spitsbergen margin during U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program Field Activity 2014-013-FA, which was carried out in conjunction with the University of Tromso and the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel on the R/V Helmer Hanssen, records 30-second-gridded methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in near-surface seawater and the atmospheric marine boundary layer, the carbon-13 isotopic composition of methane and carbon dioxide in the near-surface waters, and also environmental parameters (e.g., seawater salinity, wind speed, water and air temperatures).

To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.

What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Preflight mission analysis lead to a three spacecraft system to provide the geographic and temporal sampling required to meet this goal. Three nearly identical sets of instruments were built and launched on three separate spacecraft. These instruments differ principally in the spacecraft interface electronics and in the field-of-view limiters for the nonscanner instruments required because of differences in the spacecraft orbit altitudes.The ERBS spacecraft was launched by Space Shuttle Challenger in October 1984 and was the first spacecraft to carry ERBE instruments into orbit. ERBS was designed and built by Ball Aerospace Systems under contract to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and ERBS was the first spacecraft dedicated to NASA science experiments to be launched by the Space Shuttle. ERBS carries the Stratospheric Aerosols and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) in addition to the ERBE instruments. The Payload Operation and Control Center (POCC) at GSFC directs operations of the ERBS spacecraft and the ERBE and SAGE II instruments, employing both ground stations and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) network. Spacecraft and instrument telemetry data are received at GSFC where the data are processed by the Information Processing Division that provides ERBE and SAGE II experiment data to the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC).The second and third spacecraft launched with ERBE instruments are Television Infrared Radiometer Orbiting Satellite (TIROS) N-class spacecraft, which are part of the NOAA operational meteorological satellite series. The NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 spacecraft were launched in December 1984 and September 1986, respectively. The NOAA spacecraft include other instruments, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS), which provide NOAA with data for near-real-time weather forecasting. Both spacecraft are in nearly Sun-synchronous orbits. At launch equator-crossing times for the NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 orbits were 1420 UT (ascending) and 1930 UT (descending), respectively, where UT denotes universal time. The Satellite Operations and Control Center (SOCC) at the National Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service (NESDIS) operates the NOAA spacecraft. NOAA provides telemetry data and generates ERBE data for LaRC.From 1984 through 1994, total solar irradiance values were obtained from the solar monitor on the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) nonscanner.The individual total solar irradiance values represent orbital averages of the instantaneous measurements which are corrected for the angle between the instrument optical axis and the Sun and which are normalized to the mean Earth/Sun distance. At least once every 2 weeks, the Sun is observed by the monitor for several 64-second measurement intervals. Each interval is separated into two 32-second periods. During the first period, the Sun drifts across the9.2-degree unocculted field of view, and its radiation field is measured. During the second period, a low-emittance shutter, representative of a near-zero irradiance source, is cycled into the field of view, and the low irradiance from the back of the shutter is measured. The resulting measurements from the two different periods are used to define the irradiance, using the model that is described in Characteristics of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment Solar Monitors by R. B. Lee III, B. R. Barkstrom, and R. D. Cess. Typically, two to eight values of the irradiance are determined during an orbit. Considering that these irradiance values are derived typically during a single orbit for a few minutes, the averaged irradiance values represent an almost instantaneous level, and not a daily average."

To evaluate the hydrologic budget of the lower ACF River Basin, a groundwater-flow model, constructed using MODFLOW-2005, was developed for the Upper Floridan aquifer and overlying semiconfining unit for 2008\u00e2\u0080\u009312. Model input included temporally and spatially variable specified recharge, estimated using a preliminary version of a Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model for the ACF River Basin, and pumping, partly estimated on the basis of measured agricultural pumping rates in Georgia. The model was calibrated to measured groundwater levels, and base flows which were estimated using hydrograph separation. The simulated groundwater flow budget resulted in a net cumulative loss in groundwater storage during the study period. Spatial variability in simulated hydrologic budgets for eight subbasins was attributed to such factors as soil storage capacity, Lake Seminole impoundment, and the presence of in-channel springs. The model simulated a net storage loss for all the subbasins. The model is limited by its conceptualization, the data used to represent and calibrate the model, and the mathematical representation of the system; therefore, any interpretations should be considered in light of these limitations. In spite of these limitations, the model provides insight regarding water availability in the lower ACF River Basin. This USGS data release contains all of the input and output files for the simulations described in the associated model documentation report (https://doi.org/10.3133/sir20175141)."

This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.    Purpose    As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.    An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the Ag Data Commons, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to  establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals    compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms    determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data    ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data  Approach    The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.    Search methods    We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of \u201cagricultural data\u201d /\u201cag data\u201d / \u201cscientific data\u201d + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.    We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of \u201cagriculture\u201d, \u201cag data\u201d and \u201cuniversity\u201d to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University \u2013 International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis \u2013 Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.    Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.    Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.    Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.    Evaluation    We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.    We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.    Results    A summary of the major findings from our data review:  Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.    There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.    Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation."

This dataset contains estimates of static field geopotential of the Earth, derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission measurements, produced by the Center for Space Research (CSR) at University of Texas at Austin.  The data are in spherical harmonics averaged over approximately a month.  The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field variations.  This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 500 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 200 km apart, using a microwave ranging system.  In addition to these range change, the non-gravitional forces are measured on each satellite using a high accuracy electrostatic, room-temperature accelerometer.  The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using twin star cameras and a GPS receiver, respectively.  Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field affect the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently.  These differences are manifested as changes in the distance between the spacecraft, as they orbit the Earth.  This change in distance is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft.  The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals.  The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements.  This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the parameters of an Earth gravity field model."

Invasive species can    alter ecosystem function and structure (e.g., shift fire regimes or nutrient cycling) and change the    distribution, abundance and diversity of native species and communities. The high cost of managing    invasive species combined with decreasing budgets requires that we prioritize which invasive threats to    manage and we use scientifically credible data to inform optimal management decisions and evaluate    progress. A key first step in invasive management is identifying the species of greatest management    concern and conducting an inventory of those species to determine their distribution and abundance.    Inventory data inform management decisions and provide a baseline for evaluating progress. Although    the value of inventory data is well known, inventories are considered a daunting task for many resource    managers because of limited resources or lack of expertise on how to conduct invasive inventories. To    begin addressing these challenges, the NWRS Inventory and Monitoring Initiative and the NWRS    Invasive Species Program initiated the NWRS Invasive Plant Pilot Project (Invasive Pilot) to examine    the diversity of factors influencing how refuges plan and conduct invasive plant inventories. The goals    of the Project are to: (1) evaluate how variation in refuge size, environment, resource availability and    other factors influence planning and implementation of invasive plant inventories and (2) use this    information to inform a NWRS framework or guide for conducting invasive plant inventories. Although    the focus of this effort is on invasive plants, many of the concepts can be applied to other invasive taxa.

In the CERES EBAF-TOA product, the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes are constrained so that the global net TOA flux is consistent with our best estimate of heat storage in the Earth-atmosphere system (~0.58 Wm-2). CERES EBAF-Surface is primarily intended for studies that use Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) data to evaluate climate models, estimate the Earth's annual global mean energy budget, and infer meridional heat transports. The CERES EBAF-Surface data set is a single file in netCDF format. It consists of monthly 1 degree regional, zonal, and global averages of surface upward/downward longwave (LW), upward/downward shortwave (SW), and net fluxes under clear and all-sky conditions as well as associated net cloud radiative effects. Computed fluxes are based on hourly computations using cloud properties derived from narrowband imagers onboard both EOS Terra and Aqua satellites as well as geostationary satellites to more fully model the diurnal cycle of clouds. The computations are also based on meteorological assimilation data from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Versions 5.4.1 models. Unlike other CERES Level 3 clear-sky regional data sets that contain clear-sky data gaps, the clear-sky fluxes in the EBAF-Surface product are regionally complete. The EBAF-Surface product is the CERES project's best estimate of the fluxes based on all available satellite platforms and input data.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The newest CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011."

                "text": "El Salvador - Formal Technical Education With a budget of nearly $20 million, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was designed to strengthen technical and vocational educational institutions in the Northern Zone of El Salvador. By improving schools and offering scholarships, the sub-activity financed efforts to increase youths' access to high-quality technical education in the region, thus increasing their achievement levels, secondary (and post-secondary) school graduation rates, and prospects for gainful employment. By 2012, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was scheduled to invest $3.8 million in scholarships for students enrolled in secondary and post-secondary technical schools in the Northern Zone. According to preliminary budgets, the sub-activity would also provide $9 million to improve 20 technical secondary schools in the Northern Zone with infrastructure investments and additional teacher training programs. In addition, the sub-activity was scheduled to invest $7 million to strengthen ITCHA, an existing post-secondary institute in the Northern Zone.   In conducting the evaluation of the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity-which includes secondary and post-secondary school improvements and scholarships-Mathematica will address the following research questions regarding Sub-Activity investments from 2009 to 2012:   1.Program design/implementation. How were the secondary school strengthening and scholarship programs, and the ITCHA strengthening program designed and implemented? Did implementation meet original targets and expectations? Why or why not?  2.Description of participants. What are the characteristics (age, gender, initial household income, etc.) of scholarship recipients? What are the basic characteristics of secondary school and ITCHA students?   3.Impact/Results. What is the impact of FOMILENIO's strengthening secondary school program on students' education and labor market outcomes, including secondary school enrollment, grade completion, graduation, and further education, employment, and income? What is the impact of the offer of scholarships in some programs within strengthened schools on student educational and labor outcomes? Did ITCHA graduates obtain jobs and experience increased income following graduation? Did ITCHA students who graduated from secondary school MEGATEC programs have better academic and labor market outcomes than students who did not attend secondary school MEGATEC programs?  4.Impacts/Results by key target subgroups. Were impacts/results different for girls versus boys? What types of participants experienced positive impacts?  5.Explanation for impact findings and results. What was the ex-post statistical power, and can this explain the lack of impacts (in cases where no impacts are found)? What aspects of implementation could explain the impacts/results? If impacts/results were different for girls versus boys, why?  6.Sustainability. Are secondary school improvements and scholarships being maintained? Are ITCHA improvements being maintained? Are they likely to be maintained in the medium to long term?   To answer all research questions regarding the design, implementation, and sustainability of the strengthening efforts and scholarships (Topics 1, 2, 5, and 6), Matheatica will use a mixed-methods evaluation design that uses qualitative and quantitative methods (see Table III.1). With this approach, researchers will use qualitative methods-namely, qualitative interview data and programmatic reports-to help understand processes and activities, provide information on setting or context, and communicate the perspectives and experiences of key participants through direct quotes. In addition, Mathematica will use quantitative information on program outputs and costs, participant characteristics, and budget outlays to summarize the intervention, describe its participants, and analyze the sustainability of its original investments.   To answer research questions regarding impacts and results (3, 4, and 5), Mathematica will use a variety of designs. To determine the impact of secondary school scholarships, researchers designed and implemented a random assignment design, by which some eligible applicants were randomly selected to receive scholarships. To determine the impact of secondary school strengthening investments, Mathematica designed and implemented a matched comparison group approach using propensity score methods, by which students at the 20 strengthened schools are compared to students at 20 similar non-strengthened schools. Finally, to measure key results of the ITCHA intervention-including graduation and employment rates-researchers used a mixed-methods approach that featured a follow-up survey of ITCHA students.   All impact and results analyses rely on in-person surveys, including panel surveys of scholarship applicants, cross-sectional baseline and follow-up surveys of secondary school students, and a follow-up survey of ITCHA students."

This dataset contains estimates of the total month-by-month geopotential of the Earth, derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission measurements, produced by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). The data are provided in spherical harmonic coefficients, averaged over approximately a month. The primary objective of the GRACE-FO mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field and corresponding Earth mass change variations, such as from polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers; total water storage on land (from groundwater changes in deep aquifers to changes in soil moisture and surface water); changes in deep ocean currents; and changes within the solid Earth itself, such as postglacial rebound and the impact of major earthquakes. This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 490 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 220+/-50 km apart, using a microwave ranging system. In addition to these inter-satellite range changes, the non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite are measured using a high accuracy electrostatic accelerometer. The satellite orientation and position (and timing) are precisely measured using star cameras (with three heads per satellite) and a GPS receiver. Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field perturb the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently. These differences lead to minute changes (on the order of tens of micrometers per second) in the distance between the spacecraft as they orbit the Earth. This change in distance (or range rate) is reflected in the time-of-flight of microwave signals transmitted and received nearly simultaneously between the two spacecraft. The change in this time of fight is continuously measured by tracking the phase of the microwave carrier signals. The so called dual-one-way range change measurements can be reconstructed from these phase measurements. This range change (or its numerically derived derivatives), along with other mission and ancillary data, is subsequently analyzed to extract the geopotential coefficients of an Earth gravity field model, typically on a per-month basis."

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.              The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.              The boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2019, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.

Places always nest within a state, but                   may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place                   usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.                   CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of                   incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations                   of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under                   the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are                   defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually                   coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or                   another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the                   next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name                   as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only                   population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing                   and population."

Presence or absence of these compounds was assessed as to correlation with fibropapilloma (FP) occurrence, abnormal tissues, abnormal steroids, and/ or unusual blood chemistry in the same animal or in the mother. This project was not accomplished as proposed due to a flood that occurred on the University of Hawaii-Manoa campus. The flood caused a many-day power outage that resulted in the loss of all samples stored in freezers in buildings affected by the outage. At the time of the flood, only a few of the samples had been analyzed. Different people in the lab were analyzing different media, so we have analytical data for some nest sand, some turtle blood, but no eggs; and only PCB analyses. A second major component of the investigation included a concurrent graduate thesis nesting study on Tern Island. The nesting study provided valuable information on maternal investment and data on egg composition (protein, lipid, etc)."

The idea was to coordinate a survey of \"peenting\" woodcock at as many locations as possible with as many observers as possible in order to capture the peak calling periods for woodcock at the same time on the same day. This can be important as a single observer often has difficulty in surveying all appropriate habitat during the window of peak woodcock calling and displaying. The survey was conducted on April 21, 2001. The night prior to the actual survey, volunteers were encouraged to meet at the refuge office in order to receive specific instructions on how the survey should be completed and to have a survey route or location assigned. Routes were designated based on existing refuge survey routes as well as locations off refuge property which were know or suspected to be good woodcock breeding habitat. Participants were also asked to identify calling common snipe if they were also heard at the survey points. A total of 1 7 people participated in the woodcock survey covering nine routes and one single    observation location. Thirty-eight woodcock were counted on the survey. A total of 17 snipe were counted as well."

The records                   in this file allow users to map the parts of Urban Areas that overlap a particular                   county. After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that                   represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and                   other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of                   high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the                   \"urban footprint.\" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that                   contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500                   people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam                   which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban                   area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading                   zeroes. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana,                   these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the                   equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities,                   and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively                   for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states                   (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places                   that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions                   of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are                   treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of                   Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an                   equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the                   following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:                   Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in                   the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin                   Islands.

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local                              participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in                              situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of                              census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous                              decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000                              people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic                              status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical                              changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition,                              census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract                              boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or                              incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the                              governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in                              the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These                              noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves                              noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a                              majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized                               American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts                              that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military                              installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained                              only water area, no land area."

Weekly shore-bird, ghost crab cavities, and public use counts were made on one mile sections of Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge beach and Cape Hatteras National Seashore beach during the period of June 4 through October 16, 1977. Daily public use and wildlife surveys were run on the entire Pea Island Refuge beach during the same period. Bird numbers,, ghost crab cavities, public use and off-road vehicle use were recorded on Pea Island on weekends and weekdays. All activities were recorded on the daily surveys on Pea Island. No nesting activities were found on Cape Hatteras National Seashore beach but least terns made two unsuccessful attempts to nest on Pea Island Refuge. During the period of June 4 through September 4, on the two areas studied, total number of people were found to be about the same. However, bird use in total numbers, was more than 2 to 1 higher and ghost crab cavities were more than 4 to 1 higher on the Cape Hatteras Seashore beach than on Pea Island Refuge. Species richness for birds was also higher on Cape Hatteras Seashore. All factors considered the same, except that off-road vehicles were not allowed on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore beach, it appears that off-road vehicles, on the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge beach does have a significant effect on bird use, total number, and species richness and ghost crab populations."

                "text": "Data from: Defensive aphid symbiont Hamiltonella defensa effects on Aphelinus glycinis and Aphelinus atriplicis Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa /APSE by two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.    Insect sources and rearing conditions    Aphelinus glycinis was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect Aphis craccivora or Acyrthosiphon pisum because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.    Aphis craccivora is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Acyrthosiphon pisum is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Aphis craccivora in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and Ac. pisum were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, Vicia faba L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in H. defensa in Ac. pisum and APSE type 4 was found in H. defensa in Ap. craccivora. Aphid lines without H. defensa were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on V. fava plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of H. defensa from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from Ap. craccivora and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from Ac. craccivora were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of H. defensa and APSE prior to assays.    Aphelinus atriplicis was collected as mummified Diuraphis noxia on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; A. glycinis was collected as mummified Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. Aphelinus glycinis was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); A. atriplicis was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the Aphelinus varipes complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. Aphelinus atriplicis was reared on D. noxia on barley, Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae); Aphelinus glycinis was reared on Aphis glycines on soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of A. glycines was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither D. noxia nor A. glycines are known to harbor H. defensa, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of H. defensa in our colonies of these species. Although A. glycines harbors another bacterium, Arsenophonus, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.    Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with Hamiltonella defensa versus uninfected aphids    To measure the effect of infection with H. defensa harboring APSE on parasitism of Ap. craccivora and Ac. craccivora, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of Aphelinus atriplicis or Aphelinus glycinis that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with H. defensa or uninfected aphids on V. faba variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. Aphelinus females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.    The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.    Aphids parasitized by these Aphelinus species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.    Design structure    The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for Aphelinus glycinis on Ap. craccivora and Aphelinus atriplicis on Ap. craccivora and on Ac. pisum (24 each for Hamiltonella-infected versus uninfected aphids)."

Data consists of week number, transect, station number, species, carbon reduction pathway, habit, form, and average percent cover. It is sorted by transect, station number, then plant species. Measurements are made on 30-meter line intercept transects located perpendicular to each of 91 stations on each of the 2.7 km long Control, Treatment, and Alternate Control Transects established at the beginning of LTER-I. Following January 1, 1987, spring line- intercepts will only record cover of annual species. All perennial cover data will be limited to fall samples. Both annuals and perennials are measured during the fall. Measurements were made biannually from 1982 - 1988. After this they are measured every 5 years. Annuals are measured through 1998; however, after this only perennials are measured and only in the fall. Each plant line transect is divided into 6 5-meter segments. Annuals are measured only in the first meter of segments 1, 2, and 3 and in the last meter of segments 4, 5, and 6. Perennials are measured for the full length of all segments. BACKGROUND. In the spring of 1982, as part of the establishment of the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in southern New Mexico, a 135 ha portion of a 1500 ha, internally drained, watershed was exclosed from grazing by domestic livestock. Prior to exclosure the watershed, as well as the rest of the Jornada basin, had been moderately to heavily grazed for the past 100 years. Concurrent with grazing, the vegetation had undergone a dramatic change from desert grassland, with an almost continuous cover of C4 perennial grasses, to isolated patches of the original grassland in a mosaic with desert shrub dominated plant communities (Buffington and Herbel, 1965). The exclosure lies along a northeast facing piedmont slope at the base of a steep isolated mountain peak, and covers a variety of component landforms from the foot of the mountain to the basin floor. This provided the opportunity to investigate the response of vegetation with respect to landscape characteristics as well as release from grazing."

                "text": "Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study Introduction    Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.    Experimental Design    A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.    Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.    The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Methods    Vegetation and Soil Measurements    Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs (\uf03e 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide \u00d7 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm \u00d7 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.    Rainfall Simulations    Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105\u00b0C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).    Overland Flow Simulations    Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105\u00b0C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Resulting Data    The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.    Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center.

                "text": "Development and field-testing of survey methods for a continental marsh bird monitoring program in North America Populations of many species of secretive marsh birds are thought to be declining in North America and several species are game birds in many states and provinces. And yet, we currently lack effective monitoring programs to adequately estimate population trends of secretive marsh birds. The most commonly-used method to survey secretive marsh birds is the broadcast of recorded calls. Understanding the benefits and drawbacks associated with call-broadcast surveys is essential prior to implementing a continent-wide monitoring program. The main goal of this project was to develop a standardized monitoring protocol for secretive marsh birds that would be applicable for use throughout North America, and to have the recommended protocols fieldtested by staff of numerous National Wildlife Refuges around the country. Other goals were to use the data collected by these refuges to 1) compare vocalization probability between passive and call-broadcast surveys, 2) compare temporal variation in vocalization probability between paired passive and call-broadcast surveys, 3) determine the effect of broadcasting calls of multiple marsh birds on vocalization probability of each target species, and 4) compare observer bias between passive and call-broadcast surveys. We present a protocol that includes the use of call-broadcast for surveying marsh birds throughout North America. We include the rationale behind the various components included in the protocol. This protocol is/has already being used by 194 participants representing 45 U.S. states/territories, 3 Canadian provinces, and 3 Mexican states. The data generated has been pooled into a large relational database allowing analyses to address our initial objectives. Number of birds detected was higher for call-broadcast surveys compared to passive surveys for all 8 species examined. Coefficient of variation in number of birds detected was lower for call-broadcast surveys compared to passive surveys for most species examined. We found no evidence that broadcasting calls of other species negates the benefit of conspecific call-broadcast. Moreover, our results suggest that increasing the number of minutes of conspecific call-broadcast did not further increase the number of birds detected; 30 seconds of call-broadcast was sufficient to enhance vocalization probability of all 8 species. Observer detection probability was higher on the call-broadcast segment of the surveys compared to the passive segment of the surveys for clapper rails, but didn\u2019t differ between passive and call-broadcast for the other 6 species."

To compare efficacy of point count sampling in bottomland hardwood forests, duration of point count, number of point counts, number of visits to each point during a breeding season, and minimum sample size were examined. Minimum sample sizes were computed from the variation recorded during 82 point counts from 3 selected localities containing 3 habitat types (wet, mesic, and dry) across 3 regions of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (northern, central, and southern). For each of these point counts, all birds seen or heard during the initial 3 minutes and during each minute thereafter up to 10 minutes within three concentric distance categories (~26 m, 25 to 50 m, and >50 m> were recorded. In a second study, the effect of increasing the number of points or visits was determined by comparing the results of 150 4-minute point counts obtained from each of four stands on Delta Experimental Forest. Within each stand, bootstrap estimates of the mean cumulative number of species each year were obtained from all possible combinations of six points and six visits. Similar analyses of 384 counts obtained from 132 points distributed among 56 sites in west Tennessee bottomland forests were undertaken. Mean number of species recorded during 5- and 10-minute counts were 10.3 and 12.9 and 11.3 and 14.7 for the lower MAV and west Tennessee, respectively. There was significant variation in numbers of birds and species between regions and localities nested within regions; neither habitat nor the interaction between region and habitat was significant. Sample size sufficient to detect actual differences of some species (e.g., wood thrush [Hylocichla mustelina]) was >500; for other species (e.g., prothonotary warbler Protonotaria citrean, this same level of precision could be achieved with <10 counts. Significant differences in mean cumulative species were detected among the number of points visited and among the number of visits to a point. Although no interaction was detected between number of points and number of visits, when paired reciprocals were compared, more points invariably yielded significantly greater cumulative number of species than more visits to a point in the lower MAV. In west Tennessee, more points yielded either similar or significantly more cumulative species than more visits."

Oldsquaw (N=l8) primarily consumed amphipods (30.3% aggregate volume), gastropods (16.5%), and mysids (12.8%). The high percentage of amphipods in the diet differed from other studies at Beaufort Lagoon and elsewhere on the Beaufort Sea Coast in previous years, where mysids formed a major portion of the diet. A significantly higher number of oldsquaw in flocks (P  0.05) on oldsquaw behavior. Males molted earlier than females and most males (75%) were finished with molt when the majority of females (50%) were beginning molt (11-15 August). Males lost a significant amount of plucked body weight (wet weight), carcass weight, and breast muscle weight from premolt to early molt. A portion of that weight loss was recovered by the late molt stage. Abdominal fat deposits were utilized and not restored. Subcutaneous fat was maintained through the molt. Leg muscle weight increased through mid-molt then declined by late molt. Oldsquaw apparently catabolized small amounts of body fat and protein reserves in early molt to meet their nutritional needs in that period. The immobility of molting oldsquaw and their dependence on the lagoon food web to meet these high nutritional demands may make them highly susceptible to impacts on food sources."

Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link) is an economically important warm-season perennial used primarily as a forage and range grass in many of the drier regions throughout the subtropics and tropics. Because buffel grass has excellent drought tolerance combined with desirable forage traits, it is an important forage and range grass in parts of Africa, including South Africa. It was introduced into many of the arid subtropical regions of the world, primarily Australia, North America, and South America, and today the species is grown on more than 50 million ha worldwide. Knowledge of the ploidy, meiotic behavior, and fertility of the plants used in hybridization programs became important because success depended upon using meiotically stable parental lines with compatible chromosome numbers. Little is known about the chromosome number of the buffel grass accessions in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) because the species has small chromosomes, that makes them difficult to count using traditional cytological methods. The DNA content of 568 accessions of buffel grass in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System was determined through flow cytometry to predict their ploidy levels. Based on DNA content, 308 accessions were determined as tetraploids with 36 chromosomes, 139 as pentaploids with 45 chromosomes, 20 as hexaploids with 54 chromosomes, two as septaploids with 63 chromosomes, and 99 as aneuploids. Chromosome counts of selected plants confirmed ploidy levels from DNA findings. Chromosome number of euploid plants could be predicted from the DNA data.    The findings from this investigation reveal that the accessions in the buffel grass collection consist of a wide range of cytotypes, including polyploids and aneuploids with varying chromosome numbers. This demonstrates the amount of chromosomal diversity that occurs within the species and this collection. Grass breeders who use the buffel grass germplasm in the NPGS in their breeding programs should ensure that they know the chromosome number of the material requested. The predicted ploidy levels in Supplementary Table 1 will provide that information to the breeders."

We used a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) plug load management system to capture relevant data for two different types of multi-function devices (MFDs) in the facility, one of which was tested for use with different power settings. This enabled a quantitative analysis to assess impacts on energy consumption. It was found that a projected 65% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by using a newer, Energy Star compliant model of MFD, and an additional projected 39% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by subsequently changing the time-to-sleep for that MFD. It was also found that it may be beneficial to apply automated analysis with anomaly detection algorithms to detect problems with MFD performance, such as a failure to go to sleep mode or variations in sleep power draw. Furthermore, we observed that energy savings realized by using plug load management devices to de-energize (unplug) MFDs during non-business hours depends on the sleep power draw and time-to-sleep setting. For the MFDs in this study with settings established per the maintenance contract (which were different than factory default values), turning the device off at night and then on in the morning used more energy than leaving it on in sleep mode due to the start-up behavior and excessive time-to-sleep setting of four hours. From this and other assessments, we offer these recommendations to building occupants: reduce MFD time-to-sleep, encourage employees to use the power save button, and apply automated analysis to detect problems with device performance."

The number of species in a lagoon during a survey was influenced only by shoreline length. Weekly means of oldsquaw numbers estimated during 5 years of surveys (1981-1985) peaked during the first week in August and declined steadily into early September.

During August, 1983, 16 molting oldsquaw were captured in Tapkaurak Lagoon and fitted with a backpack radio transmitter. Birds were relocated each day that weather permitted until they departed the refuge. Over 75% of the oldsquaw relocation points were within lagoons or within 400 m of barrier islands in the ocean. Radioed oldsquaw were relatively sedentary with 47% of relocations in Tapkaurak - Oruktalik lagoon system where captured. , Nearly 90% of the relocation points were found in water less than 5 m deep. The average movement rate for the 9 oldsquaw alive at the onset of migration ranged from 1.77 to 12.20 km/day. The average daily movement rate for males exceeded that for females, but the difference was not significant. The average date of migration initiation was 22 September, and coincided with the beginning of lagoon freeze up. The relocation data suggests oldsquaw move from lagoons to offshore and ocean areas as molt is completed and migration begins. The radio relocation data is in agreement with the distribution data obtained during the 1983 aerial surveys."

                "text": "Rainfall simulation experiments in the Southwestern USA using the Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator Introduction    Preservation and management of semi-arid ecosystems requires understanding of the processes involved in soil erosion and their interaction with plant community. Rainfall simulations on natural plots provide an effective way of obtaining a large amount of erosion data under controlled conditions in a short period of time. This dataset contains hydrological (rainfall, runoff, flow velocity), erosion (sediment concentration and rate), vegetation (plant cover), and other supplementary information from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada between 2002 and 2013. The dataset advances our understanding of basic hydrological and biological processes that drive soil erosion on arid rangelands. It can be used to quantify runoff, infiltration, and erosion rates on a variety of ecological sites in the Southwestern USA. Inclusion of wildfire and brush treatment locations combined with long term observations makes it important for studying vegetation recovery, ecological transitions, and effect of management. It is also a valuable resource for erosion model parameterization and validation.    Instrumentation    Rainfall was generated by a portable, computer-controlled, variable intensity simulator (Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator). The WGRS can deliver rainfall rates ranging between 13 and 178 mm/h with variability coefficient of 11% across 2 by 6.1 m area. Estimated kinetic energy of simulated rainfall was 204 kJ/ha/mm and drop size ranged from 0.288 to 7.2 mm. Detailed description and design of the simulator is available in Stone and Paige (2003). Prior to each field season the simulator was calibrated over a range of intensities using a set of 56 rain gages. During the experiments windbreaks were setup around the simulator to minimize the effect of wind on rain distribution. On some of the plots, in addition to rainfall only treatment, run-on flow was applied at the top edge of the plot. The purpose of run-on water application was to simulate hydrological processes that occur on longer slopes ([HTML_REMOVED]6 m) where upper portion of the slope contributes runoff onto the lower portion.    Runoff rate from the plot was measured using a calibrated V-shaped supercritical flume equipped with depth gage. Overland flow velocity on the plots was measured using electrolyte and fluorescent dye solution. Dye moving from the application point at 3.2 m distance to the outlet was timed with stopwatch. Electrolyte transport in the flow was measured by resistivity sensors imbedded in edge of the outlet flume. Maximum flow velocity was defined as velocity of the leading edge of the solution and was determined from beginning of the electrolyte breakthrough curve and verified by visual observation (dye). Mean flow velocity was calculated using mean travel time obtained from the electrolyte solution breakthrough curve using moment equation.    Soil loss from the plots was determined from runoff samples collected during each run. Sampling interval was variable and aimed to represent rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph, any changes in runoff rate, and steady state conditions. This resulted in approximately 30 to 50 samples per simulation.    Shortly before every simulation plot surface and vegetative cover was measured at 400 point grid using a laser and line-point intercept procedure (Herrick et al., 2005). Vegetative cover was classified as forbs, grass, and shrub. Surface cover was characterized as rock, litter, plant basal area, and bare soil. These 4 metrics were further classified as protected (located under plant canopy) and unprotected (not covered by the canopy). In addition, plant canopy and basal area gaps were measured on the plots over three lengthwise and six crosswise transects.    Experimental procedure    Four to eight 6.1 m by 2 m replicated rainfall simulation plots were established on each site. The plots were bound by sheet metal borders hammered into the ground on three sides. On the down slope side a collection trough was installed to channel runoff into the measuring flume. If a site was revisited, repeat simulations were always conducted on the same long term plots.    The experimental procedure was as follows. First, the plot was subjected to 45 min, 65 mm/h intensity simulated rainfall (dry run) intended to create initial saturated condition that could be replicated across all sites. This was followed by a 45 minute pause and a second simulation with varying intensity (wet run). During wet runs two modes of water application were used as: rainfall or run-on. Rainfall wet runs typically consisted of series of application rates (65, 100, 125, 150, and 180 mm/h) that were increased after runoff had reached steady state for at least five minutes. Runoff samples were collected on the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph and during each steady state (a minimum of 3 samples). Overland flow velocities were measured during each steady state as previously described. When used, run-on wet runs followed the same procedure as rainfall runs, except water application rates varied between 100 and 300 mm/h. In approximately 20% of simulation experiments the wet run was followed by another simulation (wet2 run) after a 45 min pause. Wet2 runs were similar to wet runs and also consisted of series of varying intensity rainfalls and/or run-on inputs.    Resulting Data    The dataset contains hydrological, erosion, vegetation, and ecological data from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 12 sq. m plots at 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada. The experiments were conducted between 2002 and 2013, with some locations being revisited multiple times."

                "text": "Effect of fire and grazing on invasive species in northern mixed grass prairie Invasive plants pose a threat to pristine and natural mixed grass prairie so managers seek to control them. On the basis of experience in the tall grass prairie, some hypothesize that they may be controlled with fire and grazing. The fact that the invaders are cool season species in a cool season prairie, rather than cool season species in a warm season matrix, reduces the possibility of selectively treating them- - and casts doubt on the applicability of these tools in mixed grass prairie. Long-term management experiments at Lostwood and Des Lacs National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) provide a near ideal opportunity to test these hypotheses. The replicated factorial experiment includes six burning treatments (0-6 burns) crossed with two grazing (grazed and ungrazed) treatments. By subsampling each unit, one can estimate the local (bottom, Nslope, S-slope, and hilltop) and regional (North Dakota vs. Montana) effects of water availability. We field-sampled units to compare the spread of nine species - - i.e., the long distance dispersal (frequency) and clonal spread (cover) - - among these treatments. Responses to various aspects of fire and grazing were measured with multiple regression. The species studied included two perennial grasses (Bromus inermis and Poa pratensis), three woody plants (Symphoricarpos occidentalis, Populus tremuloides, and Elaeagnus commutata), two perennial forbs (Cirsium arvense and Euphorbia esula) and two biennial forbs (Melilotus officinalis and Tragopogon dubius). The growth (+) of invaders with very different ecological strategies were highly correlated (p=0.0001-0.01) with aspects of environment, grazing, and fire. The responses were, however, not strong, that is, slopes of the regression lines were low and little of the variance was accounted for (low r2). In addition, the responses were inconsistent between the two nearby refuges. Thus, while managers use fire and grazing for other reasons (e.g., management of woody biomass, litter, and wildlife habitat), we see no evidence that either is useful for weed control."

                "text": "Biodiversity plots vegetation transects Design and hypotheses. The treatments are designed to distinguish the effects of plant biomass per se from those of plant functional groups and plant species richness within functional groups. We recorded the mass of plants removed from the plots when the treatments were imposed in 1995; the total biomass removed from a plot is an index of the disturbance associated with the start of the experiment. One hypothesis is that plant biomass, rather than the species or functional group composition of the plants, is the critical regulator of ecosystem function. If so, most response variables would be highly correlated with initial biomass removed in the early seasons of the experiment. If remaining species increase in biomass over time, to the point where all treatments support approximately equal biomass, that correlation (and the differences among treatments) should disappear. Another hypothesis is that the architecture and physiology of different groups of plants differ sufficiently that each functional group contributes in a unique way to ecosystem function. We therefore are testing the impact of removing various groups or growth forms from the plant community. Four treatments involve the removal of all individuals of all species of a given functional group of perennial plants: shrubs, subshrubs, perennial grasses, and succulents (both leaf and stem succulents). That is, one treatment involves the removal of all shrubs from a plot; another the removal of all perennial grasses, and so on. All other treatments (Control plus three other treatments) contain at least some species representative of all functional groups, so the contrast between the functional group removals and these other treatments should reflect the effect of functional group diversity. There are multiple species in each of the functional groups, so an additional hypothesis is that higher species richness within a functional group alters ecosystem function significantly. We have imposed a Simplified treatment, where only a single species (the most abundant species at the time of initiation) of each of the four groups remains, and all other species of those functional groups have been removed. That is, the Simplified plots contain a single shrub (Larrea tridentata), a single subshrub (Zinnia acerosa), a single succulent (Yucca baccata), and a single perennial grass (Muhlenbergia porteri). In contrast, we have also imposed two versions of a Reduced diversity treatment, where the dominant species have been removed and the subordinate species remain. (In one version of this treatment, Larrea is assumed to be the dominant shrub and was removed; in another version, Prosopis is assumed to be dominant and is removed. In both of these, the dominants of other growth forms are as identified above in the Simplified treatment.) Finally, in the Control, all species (dominant and subordinate) of all four functional groups remain. Hence the contrast among the Control, the Reduced, and the Simplified treatments should reflect the importance of species richness within functional groups. Response variables: The vegetation transects are measured once or twice a year to assess the response of the plant community to the manipulations of species and functional diversity. (Measurements are every fall at a minimum. When resources permit and vegetation seems to deserve it, spring sampling will also be carried out (2 x per year)"

The number of breeding kittiwakes, gulls and terns of both species declined in 1978 whereas the number of breeding tufted puffins remained rather constant. Likewise productivity at all stages of breeding: number of eggs laid, number of chicks hatched, number of chicks fledged and chicks fledged per nest attempt declined for all of the above surface and cliff nesters, but not for the tufted puffins. The decline in reproductive output in 1978 was due to a number of factors: fewer breeding birds, fewer eggs laid to begin with, increased predation of eggs and chicks by mew and glaucous-winged gulls, ravens, northwest crows and bald eagles, and perhaps a change in the prey base. The prey base for all of the species studied changed radically from 1977 to 1978. In 1977, capelin, Mallotus villosus, was by far the most important prey with respect to numbers and frequency of occurrence. In 1978 capelin was replaced by sandlance, Ammodytes hexapterus as the most important prey and was found in significantly fewer numbers and in significantly fewer of the regurgitations and bill loads of the birds than it was in 1977. This decline of capelin in 1978 may have somehow influenced the decrease in numbers of breeding birds and also their lowered reproductive success."

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

CAUs allow for recruitment and colonization of Crustose Corraline Algae and hard corals. By measuring the change in weight of the CAUs, the reef carbonate accretion rate can be calculated for that time period. Monitoring net accretion over successive deployments allows for the detection of changes in calcification rates over time.  This study provides information about spatial patterns of algal calcification and accretion rates and serves as a basis for detecting changes associated with changing seawater chemistry due to ocean acidification. These data can also be used in comparative analyses across natural gradients, thereby assisting efforts to determine whether key reef-building taxa can acclimatize to changing oceanographic environments. These data will have immediate, direct impacts on predictions of reef resilience in a higher carbon dioxide (CO2) world and on the design of reef management strategies."

                "text": "Ghana - Agriculture - Feeder Roads The Ghana Millennium Development Authority's (MiDA) Agriculture Project within the Government of Ghana's Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation is design to improve farming in a number of areas. Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

                "text": "Nicaragua - Transportation The evaluation examines impacts of the Transportation Project in three ways. First, we calculate economic rates of return associated with reduced user costs for each rehabilitated road - and for the project in aggregate - making use of the before and after measures of road use, detailed data on project implementation and costs, and models that project changes in usage, costs, and benefits over time.   We also examine changes in the availability and cost of common consumption goods that can be attributed to the transportation project. This component of the analysis relies on a survey of retail establishments that targets goods in the Cansta Basica or basic basket that is used in Nicaragua to track consumer prices. Data was collected both before and after construction in communities both on and away from rehabilitated roads. The survey design therefore facilitates measurement of changes in price and availability of goods relative to a relevant comparison group.   The evaluation also examines changes in household consumption using a similar pre- and post- rehabilitation data collection methodology. The consumption measures for this component of the evaluation are derived from responses to household surveys implemented for the Rural Business Development (RBD) portion of the Nicaragua compact. While the bulk of the respondents to this survey are outside the zone of influence of the road rehabilitation, we identify more than one-hundred households within the zone of influence of the rehabilitated roads. It is important to recognize that the data for this component of the report was collected for a different purpose and respondents are not a representative sample of households in the treatment and control areas. Thus these results are intended to be suggestive and provide some insight on the robustness of results from the survey of retail establishments. These surveys do not provide unbiased estimates of the transportation project on the affected population."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

(2012). Five CAUs were deployed at each survey site. Climate sites were established in Timore-Leste by CREP in October 2012 to establish ecological baselines for climate change by measuring multiple features of the coral reef environment (in addition to the data described herein) over time.   CAUs, constructed in-house by CREP, are composed of two 10 x 10 cm flat, square, gray PVC plates, stacked 1 cm apart, and are attached to the benthos by SCUBA divers using stainless steel threaded rods. Deployed on the seafloor for a period of time, calcareous organisms, primarily crustose coralline algae and encrusting corals, recruit to these plates and accrete/calcify carbonate skeletons over time. By measuring the change in weight of the CAUs, the reef carbonate accretion rate can be calculated for that time period, measured in grams per centimeter per year.  Laboratory experiments reveal calcification rates of crustose coralline algae (CCA) are strongly correlated to seawater aragonite saturation state. Predictions of reduced coral calcification rates, due to ocean acidification, suggest that coral reef communities will undergo ecological phase shifts as calcifying organisms are negatively impacted by changing seawater chemistry. CAUs are used by CREP to assess the current effects of changes in seawater carbonate chemistry on calcification and accretion rates of calcareous and fleshy algae.  These calcification rate data for Timor-Leste, along with other data collected at the climate survey sites (water temperature and chemistry, invertebrate biodiversity, and benthic cover, all archived separately), serve as a baseline for detecting changes associated with changing seawater chemistry and can be used to help scientists assess and understand how Timor-Leste's coral reefs are responding to ocean acidification. The data can be accessed online via the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Ocean Archive."

This is a PI led dataset produced at the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) at the University of Hawaii (Manoa) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. The optimal interpolation (OI) mapping procedure used to create this product corrects for systematic spatial biases in Aquarius SSS data with respect to near-surface in situ salinity observations and takes into account available statistical information about the signal and noise, specific to the Aquarius instrument.  Bias fields are constructed by differencing in situ from  Aquarius derived SSS fields obtained separately using ascending and descending satellite observations  for each of the three Aquarius beams, and by removal of small-scale noise and low-pass filtering along-track using a two-dimensional  Hanning window procedures prior to application of the OI algorithm. Additional enhancements for this new version of the product include: 1) The V5.0 (end-of mission) version of Aquarius Level-2 (swath) SSS data are used as input data for the OI SSS analysis. 2) The source of the first guess fields has changed from the APDRC Argo-derived SSS product to the average of four different in-situ based SSS products. 3) The bias correction algorithm has changed to adjust SSS retrievals for large-scale systematic biases on a repeat-track basis. 4) New, less restrictive thresholds are implemented to filter observations for land and ice contamination, thus improving coverage in the coastal areas and semi-enclosed seas. 5) Level-2 RFI masks for descending and ascending satellite passes  are used to discard observations in specific geographic zones where excessive ascending-descending differences are observed due to contamination from undetected RFI. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit. Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath. The Aquarius polar orbit is sun synchronous at 657 km with a 6 pm, ascending node, and has a 7-Day repeat cycle."

Additionally, ESI maps can be used by planners--before a spill happens--to identify vulnerable locations, establish protection priorities, and identify cleanup strategies.  Shoreline rankings rate how sensitive an area of shoreline would be to an oil spill. The ranking scale goes from 1 to 10. A rank of 1 represents shorelines with the least susceptibility to damage by oiling. Examples include steep, exposed rocky cliffs and banks. The oil cannot penetrate into the rock and will be washed off quickly by the waves and tides. A rank of 10 represents shorelines most likely to be damaged by oiling. Examples include protected, vegetated wetlands, such as mangrove swamps and saltwater marshes. Oil in these areas will remain for a long period of time, penetrate deeply into the substrate, and inflict damage to many kinds of plants and animals.

Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath."

                "text": "Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study Introduction    Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.    Experimental Design    A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.    Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.    The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Methods    Vegetation and Soil Measurements    Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs (\uf03e 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide \u00d7 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm \u00d7 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.    Rainfall Simulations    Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105\u00b0C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).    Overland Flow Simulations    Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105\u00b0C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Resulting Data    The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.    Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center. This dataset is contribution number 134 of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project."

The oil cannot penetrate into the rock and will be washed off quickly by the waves and tides. A rank of 10 represents habitats most likely to be damaged by oiling. Examples include protected, vegetated wetlands, such as mangrove swamps and saltwater marshes. Oil in these areas will remain for a long period of time, penetrate deeply into the substrate, and inflict damage to many kinds of plants and animals.

For each monitored furrow, irrigation inflow rates, outflow rates, and sediment concentrations were recorded periodically during the irrigation.  A gated pipe conveyed irrigation water across the plots at the head, or inflow-end, of the furrows and adjustable spigots supplied water to each irrigated furrow.  The methodology used to obtain the field data is described by Lentz and Sojka (2009).  Inflows were measured by timing the filling rate of a known volume, and runoff were measured with long-throated, v-notch flumes. Outflows were measured and runoff samples collected at 30 min intervals during the first 1-3 hr of an irrigation, and every hour or two for the next 3 to 5 hr.  If the set was continued for an additional 12 hr, two to four additional measurements were made.  Immediately after each flume reading, sediment concentration in furrow streams were measured by collecting one-liter runoff samples from free-flowing flume discharge.  The weight of sediment per liter of runoff was determined from the settled volume of sediment using the Imhoff-cone technique.  Three Imhoff-cone sediment samples were collected from each treatment in each irrigation.  These were filtered, and the papers dried and weighed.  A calibration function relating the 30-min, settled-sediment volume to sediment mass-per-unit-volume of runoff was then calculated and used to convert settled sediment volume in cones to sediment mass.    The field data for each study or year were analyzed using the WASHOUT program (Lentz and Sojka, 1995).  The WASHOUT program produces an output file (filename.out), which become components of this Ag Data Commons data set.    For many years and irrigations, furrows were monitored at one or more locations along the furrow, as well as at the end (bottom) of the furrow.  In these cases, data for each position within the furrow are listed in the data set, labelled for example as 'Top', 'Middle', and 'Bottom' (See Data Dictionary tab).  For each furrow position the data represent the flow, infiltration, and runoff information for the length of furrow, which begins at its inflow end (top of the field) and ends at the defined furrow position.  This distance is listed in the field data file for each furrow and irrigation.    An Irrigation Data Summary is included as a tab in the data set spreadsheet.  This is a summary list of the studies and irrigations that are included in the data set.

Monitoring net accretion over successive deployments allows for the detection of changes in calcification rates over time.  This study provides information about spatial patterns of algal calcification and accretion rates and serves as a basis for detecting changes associated with changing seawater chemistry due to ocean acidification. These data can also be used in comparative analyses across natural gradients, thereby assisting efforts to determine whether key reef-building taxa can acclimatize to changing oceanographic environments. These data will have immediate, direct impacts on predictions of reef resilience in a higher carbon dioxide (CO2) world and on the design of reef management strategies."

                "text": "PODAAC-CYGNS-L2H10 This dataset contains the Version 1.0 CYGNSS Level 2 Surface Flux Science Data Record, which provides the time-tagged and geolocated ocean surface heat flux parameters with 25x25 kilometer footprint resolution from the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) aboard the CYGNSS satellite constellation. The reported sample locations are determined by the specular points corresponding to the Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs). Only one netCDF-4 data file is produced each day (each file containing data from a combination of up to 8 unique CYGNSS spacecraft) with a latency of approximately 1 month from the last recorded measurement time. Version 1.0 represents the first release. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), launched on 15 December 2016, is a NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder Mission that was launched with the purpose to collect the first frequent space-based measurements of surface wind speeds in the inner core of tropical cyclones. Made up of a constellation of eight micro-satellites, the CYGNSS observatories provide nearly gap-free Earth coverage with a mean (i.e., average) revisit time of seven hours and a median revisit time of three hours. The 35 degree orbital inclination allows CYGNSS to measure ocean surface winds between approximately 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South latitude using an innovative combination of all-weather performance Global Positioning System (GPS) L-band ocean surface reflectometry to penetrate the clouds and heavy precipitation. The Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) algorithm is what is used in this dataset to estimate the latent and sensible heat fluxes and their respective transfer coefficients. While COARE's initial intentions were for low to moderate wind speeds, the version used for this product, COARE 3.5, has been verified with direct in situ flux measurements for wind speeds up to 25 m/s. As CYGNSS does not provide air/sea temperature, humidity, surface pressure or density, the producer of this dataset obtains these values from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), which uses data assimilation to combine all available in situ and satellite observation data with an initial estimate of the atmospheric state, provided by a global atmospheric model. The data from this release compares well with in situ buoy data, including: Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO), National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), Ocean Sustained Interdisciplinary Time-series Environment observation System (OceanSITES), Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA), Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA), and the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array. As this marks only the first data release, future work is expected to provide comparisons and validation with various field campaigns (e.g., PISTON, CAMP2Ex) as well as more buoy data, especially at higher flux estimates."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Snow storms during late August stimulated strong southeasterlv movements of caribou from Alaska, however, caribou drifted back north during mild weather in September. Some caribou returned to Alaska during late fall (October) movements. At the onset of winter conditions (November), large numbers of caribou were located in the northern Richardson Mountains in Canada where thev remained during the winter of 1984-1985. Rased on proportions of radio-collared caribou found, it is estimated that about 50,000 caribou wintered on traditional ranges in Alaska and about 90,000 caribou wintered in the northern Richardson Mountains and Yukon north slope in Canada. First year mortalitv (based on survival rates of radio-collared calves) was estimated at 3R% for 1984-1985. Male calves had a higher first year mort ali tv rate (53%) than female calves ( 23%). Annual mortality of (1-3 year old) radio-collared caribou (5%) was significantly lower than that for adults older than 3 years (32%). Following a brief period of; higher mortality immediately after parturition, calves survived well until fall, when detected mortality again increased. Overwinter mortality of radio-collared calves was low. This pattern was similar to that identified for the 1983 calf cohort."

In addition, within the T&D intervention group, we randomly assigned some communities to receive the financing scheme (FS) initiative. To assess impacts of the FS initiative, we compared outcomes of households in the randomly selected treatment communities with those of households in the control communities, adjusting for baseline characteristics. The key research questions we addressed were: (1) What are the impacts of being in communities selected to receive lines through the T&D activity? (2) What are the impacts of being in communities selected to receive low-cost connections through the FS initiative? (3) What are the impacts of being connected to the national grid? (4) Do the impacts vary by gender, age, income, or urbanicity?   Both the T&D analysis and the FS analysis utilize data from a baseline survey (conducted in 2011) and from a follow-up survey (conducted in 2015). The follow-up data are provided in this package. Key findings from the final evaluation include the following:  \u00b7   The T&D activity led to a large number of new connections, but it was less than a third of the 35,000 connections assumed at the outset.    \u00b7   The FS initiative also increased connection rates, but even if all T&D communities received low-cost connections, the number of connections originally assumed would still have not been achieved.     \u00b7   The T&D activity, FS initiative, and connection to the grid increased consumption of grid electricity, ownership of electric tools, time spent watching television, and perceived household safety.    \u00b7   The T&D activity increased the percentage of households doing an income-generating activity (IGA) that used grid electricity.    \u00b7   The FS initiative reduced poverty as measured by per capita consumption under $1 or $2 per day.     \u00b7   Being connected increased children's hours of studying at night, but it increased TV watching much more; being connected also increased income and reduced poverty.

This ranking system serves as a first step for land managers to prioritize areas for check-dam installation based on relatively static factors (soil properties, topography, and hydrology) that can contribute to rates of soil erosion by water and the stability of check-dams. Many other relatively dynamic factors over time can contribute to rates of soil erosion by water, such as recent wildfire events, changes in weather patterns and extreme climate events, and changing land-use such as grazing, logging, mining, development, and cultivation. These factors that influence vegetative and biological soil crusts cover are also important elements to the potential erosion of soil by water. Because of this, SRLCC stakeholders might consider further evaluation of the watersheds identified here as high ranking. Final watershed prioritization among the high-ranking watersheds identified here should include current knowledge of land-use and land-cover estimates to identify areas at risk for soil erosion or degree of existing erosion problems."

Virtual Sensors are a class of algorithms that estimate the value of a time series given other potentially nonlinearly correlated sensor readings.  In the case presented here, the Virtual Sensors algorithm is based on an ensemble learning approach and takes sensor readings and control signals as input to estimate the pressure in a subsystem of the Main Propulsion System.  Our results indicate that this method can detect faults in the FCV at the time when they occur.  We use the standard deviation of the predictions of the ensemble as a measure of uncertainty in the estimate.  This uncertainty estimate was crucial to understanding the nature and magnitude of transient characteristics during startup of the engine.   This paper overviews the Virtual Sensors algorithm and discusses results on a comprehensive set of Shuttle missions and also discusses the architecture necessary for deploying such algorithms in a real-time, closed-loop system or a human-in-the-loop monitoring system. These results were presented at a Flight Readiness Review of the Space Shuttle in early 2009."

                "text": "Damage Propagation Modeling for Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Simulation This paper describes how damage propagation can be modeled within the modules of aircraft gas turbine engines. To that end, response surfaces of all sensors are generated via a thermo-dynamical simulation model for the engine as a function of variations of flow and efficiency of the modules of interest. An exponential rate of change for flow and efficiency loss was imposed for each data set, starting at a randomly chosen initial deterioration set point. The rate of change of the flow and efficiency denotes an otherwise unspecified fault with increasingly worsening effect. The rates of change of the faults were constrained to an upper threshold but were otherwise chosen randomly. Damage propagation was allowed to continue until a failure criterion was reached. A health index was defined as the minimum of several superimposed operational margins at any given time instant and the failure criterion is reached when health index reaches zero. Output of the model was the time series (cycles) of sensed measurements typically available from aircraft gas turbine engines. The data generated were used as challenge data for the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) data competition at PHM\u201908."

(2012). Five CAUs were deployed at each survey site. Climate sites were established in Timore-Leste by CREP in October 2012 to establish ecological baselines for climate change by measuring multiple features of the coral reef environment (in addition to the data described herein) over time.   CAUs, constructed in-house by CREP, are composed of two 10 x 10 cm flat, square, gray PVC plates, stacked 1 cm apart, and are attached to the benthos by SCUBA divers using stainless steel threaded rods. Deployed on the seafloor for a period of time, calcareous organisms, primarily crustose coralline algae and encrusting corals, recruit to these plates and accrete/calcify carbonate skeletons over time. By measuring the change in weight of the CAUs, the reef carbonate accretion rate can be calculated for that time period, measured in grams per centimeter per year.  Laboratory experiments reveal calcification rates of crustose coralline algae (CCA) are strongly correlated to seawater aragonite saturation state. Predictions of reduced coral calcification rates, due to ocean acidification, suggest that coral reef communities will undergo ecological phase shifts as calcifying organisms are negatively impacted by changing seawater chemistry. CAUs are used by CREP to assess the current effects of changes in seawater carbonate chemistry on calcification and accretion rates of calcareous and fleshy algae.  These calcification rate data for Timor-Leste, along with other data collected at the climate survey sites (water temperature and chemistry, invertebrate biodiversity, and benthic cover, all archived separately), serve as a baseline for detecting changes associated with changing seawater chemistry and can be used to help scientists assess and understand how Timor-Leste's coral reefs are responding to ocean acidification. The data can be accessed online via the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Ocean Archive."

Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths climbed slowly from a rate of 521.0 per 100,000 in 2001 to 615.7 per 100,000 in 2005.  The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.    Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.

Major findings include 46 deaths involving trauma, 19 deaths involving infection, 36 deaths involving ingested lead, 14 deaths involving plastic entanglement, and 26 deaths involving aspergillosis. This report contains toxicological data (liver and kidney tissue analysis) from a subset of 34 individuals found that lead, mercury, aluminum, selenium, iron, and cadmium concentrations were elevated in the northeastern United States loon population. In adults, liver lead concentrations ranged from <0.06 to 31.09 parts per million (ppm), and liver mercury levels ranged from 0.989 to 100.483 ppm. Ingested lead (mostly fishing sinkers and jigs) was found in 60.0 % of the adult loons from freshwater lakes. In most cases lead ingestion was accompanied by elevated liver lead levels. It is believed that the loons who ingested lead objects died from acute lead toxicosis. Results of this study confirm that much of summer loon mortality is closely linked to anthropogenic activities on and near breeding lakes."

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).    Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

                "text": "NCHS - Teen Birth Rates for Age Group 15-19 in the United States by County This data set contains estimated teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) by county and year.    DEFINITIONS    Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.    Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.    Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.    NOTES    Data on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).    Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.    Hierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).    The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that    1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,    where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).    County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).    SOURCES    National Center for Health Statistics.

Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015.

Radio-transmitters were attached to a total of 113 different bears during this time period and these bears were monitored through denning (October - November) each year. More males were captured in age classes 5.5 years of age or less, while females were more abundant in age classes 6.5 years old and older. No natural mortalities occurred among sample bears in 1982, however, 10 apparent mortalities occurred among 17 young bears (cubs and yearlings) in 1983. In 1984, 13 of 24 young bears were apparent mortalities, and in 1985, 18 of 40 young bears were apparent mortalities. Reasons for these high mortality rates in 1983 (58.9%), 1984 (54.2%), and 1985 (45.0%) among young bears is unknown. Four mortalities were recorded during 1985. An adult female (19.5-year old) and an adult male (20.5-year old) died over winter of exposure and drowning, repectively. Two bears ( a 13.5-year old female and a 3.5-year old male) were shot by hunters. Brown bears were observed feeding on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) carcasses (adults and calves) on 6 occasions in 1982, on 15 occasions in 1983, on 20 occasions in 1984, and on 31 occasions in 1985. Preliminary analysis of radio-relocation data indicate that brown bears appear to shift habitat use patterns to coastal areas in June and early July to coincide with occupancy of those habitats by calving and post-calving caribou. Emerged from winter dens occurred in late occurred in late April and throughout May in 1983 and 1985, but was confined to late April through mid-May in 1984, with early emergence of males and non-parturient females and later emergence of females with cubs of the year. Elevations of den sites averaged 816 \u00b1 6lm(SE) in 1983, 966 \u00b1 46m(SE) in 1984, and 964 \u00b1 64m(SE) in 1985. Aspects of den sites were predominantly southeast facing slopes (mean aspect, 1983 = 145\u00b0\u00b120\u00b0SE; 1984 = 150\u00b0\u00b1l8\u00b0SE; 1985 = 146\u00b0++ l8\u00b0SE). Slope of den sites averaged 54\u00b1 4%SE in 1983, 56\u00b1 2%SE in 1984, and 58\u00b1 3%SE in 1985. In October and November, bears moved south into foothill and mountainous habitats to den. Only two bears in each year denned on the coastal plain and foothill habitats in the 1002c study area in 1983, 1984 and 1985."

Snow storms during late August stimulated strong southeasterly movements of caribou from Alaska, however, caribou drifted back north during mild weather in September. Some caribou returned to Alaska during late fall (October) movements. At the onset of winter conditions (November), large numbers of caribou were located in the northern Richardson Mountains in Canada where they remained during the winter of 1984-1985. Based on proportions of radio-collared caribou found, it is estimated that about 50,000 caribou wintered on traditional ranges in Alaska and about 90,000 caribou wintered in the northern Richardson Mountains and Yukon north slope in Canada. First year mortality (based on survival rates of radio-collared calves) was estimated at 3R% for 1984-1985. Male calves had a higher first year mortality rate (53%) than female calves ( 23%). Annual mortality of (1-3 year old) radio-collared caribou (5%) was significantly lower than that for adults older than 3 years (32%). Following a brief period of; higher mortality immediately after parturition, calves survived well until fall, when detected mortality again increased. Overwinter mortality of radio-collared calves was low. This pattern was similar to that identified for the 1983 calf cohort."

SCAMS was designed to map tropospheric temperature profiles, water vapor abundance, and cloud water content to be used for weather prediction even in the presence of clouds, which block conventional satellite infrared sensors. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from 9-track magnetic tapes. The data are archived in their original IBM 32-bit word binary record format, also referred to as a binary TAP file, and contain one orbit of measurements.              The SCAMS experiment on Nimbus-6 is a follow on to the successful Nimbus-5 NEMS experiment.  SCAMS continuously monitored emitted microwave radiation at frequencies of 22.235, 31.65, 52.85, 53.85 and 55.45 GHz. The three channels near the 5.0-mm oxygen absorption band were used primarily to deduce atmospheric temperature profiles. The two channels near 10 mm permitted water vapor and cloud water content over calm oceans to be estimated separately. The instrument, a Dicke-superheterodyne type, scanned +/- 45 degrees normal to the orbital plane with a 10 degree field of view. The three oxygen channels shared common signal and reference antennas. Both water vapor channels had their own signals and reference antennas. The absolute rms accuracy of the oxygen channels was better than 2 Kelvin and that of the water vapor channels better than 1 Kelvin.                              The SCAMS Principal Investigator was Prof. David H. Staelin from MIT. The Nimbus-6 SCAMS data are available from June 15, 1975 (day of year 166) through May 31, 1976 (day of year 152).

Radio-transmitters were attached to 32 of the 50 bears and these bears were monitored through denning in October and early November. More females were captured in age classes 6.5 year old and less, while males were more abundant in 7.5 year old and older age classes. Survival of immature bears appears good from year to year based on the percentage of captured bears in each age class. No mortality was detected within the immature age classes. Preliminary data interpretation indicate that the coastal plain and foothills habitats may be used more often by younger age classes and females with young than older bear without young. Preliminary calculations of range size indicated that young bears moved over larger areas than adult bears. In all cases, range sizes determined in this study were less than recorded for brown bears in northwest Alaska and northeast Alaska. Brown bears were observed feeding on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) carcasses on 6 occasions during the study. These instances were the only recorded interactions between the 2 species, except one unsuccessful chase of a bull caribou by a bear on 23 August. Dens were located for 28 radio-collared bears and dens of 10 unmarked bears were located during aerial surveys for bear dens. Bears moved south into the foothills and mountainous habitats to den, except for 2 radio-collared bears. One brown bear denned in the coastal plain and one denned in the foothills of Marsh Creek.

In the 809 days we were present, we conducted 53 studies or surveys of birds in the region. We gathered information on 185 species, of which 65% (121) nested, 10% (19) probably nested, and 11% (21) were permanent residents in the region. Most breeding or probably breeding forms were of North American (58%; 81) or Beringian (24%; 33) affinity, while the remainder of the species were of Panborcal (17%; 24) and Old World (1%; 2) affinity. Similarly, most of the 44 migrants and visitants were of North American (41%; 18) affinity, while the remainder were of Beringian (32%; 14) and Panboreal (27%; 12) afilnity. Of the 140 species that nested or probably nested, 53% (73) were abundant to fairly common, 29% (40) were uncommon to very rare, and 20% (27) were localized. Shrub thicket, dwarf shrub mat, coniferous forest, deciduous forest, mixed deciduous-coniferous forest, and fluviatile water and shoreline habitats supported the greatest diversity of species breeding and suspected of breeding. The highest concentrations of birds occurred in the estuaries of Nanvak, Chagvan, and Goodnews bays during spring and fall migrations and on the coastal and island cliffs during the breeding season. The information presented here provides the basis for range extensions of several species.

The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge was once of 13 nuclear weapons production facilities in the United States during the Cold War and was managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). The plant operated from 1952 to 1994 with manufacturing activities taking place in the center portion of the site with a large buffer zone around the area. In 1989, nuclear production work stopped to address environmental and safety concerns. Although work resumed in 1990, the mission was terminated when President George H. W. Bush canceled the W-88 Trident Warhead program in 1992. Nuclear and nonnuclear production stopped in 1993, and in 1994 the last shipment of defense-related materials was sent off-site.When the facility\u2019s mission changed from production to cleanup and closure, it was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). The site was added to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Priorities List (Superfund List) in 1989. With oversight from the EPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE), the DOE completed the $7 billion dollar cleanup in 2005. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001 (Pub.L. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1379, enacted December 8, 2001), mandated that once remediation was complete the site would become a national wildlife refuge.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) policy requires a Level III Preacquisition Survey when it is determined, on the basis of the Level I or II Survey, that there is a reasonable basis to assume that hazardous substances were present on the real property or that there were effects of such hazardous substances present at the site, and extensive work (e.g. \"significant\" sampling and original research) is required to determine the extent of any hazardous substance, obtain an estimate of the remediation or other cleanup costs, and determine whether reprogramming is required. Although no formal Level I or II Surveys were conducted at the RFETS, the history of the site, coupled with evidence of contamination revealed during extensive DOE and contractor sampling, before and during the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), provided reasonable basis to conduct a Modified Level III Survey.This report concludes that the review of the data collected by DOE and their contractors and stored in the RI-ready database showed that the database used for the Remedial Investigation was of adequate quality to make determinations on the clean up process and the comprehensive risk assessment. The Service was included in the comprehensive risk assessment workgroup and was presented the opportunity, along with the EPA and CDPHE to comment on the development and assumptions used in the risk assessment. The comprehensive risk assessment was conservative enough in its assumptions that clean up work that was completed by DOE and its contractor, for all receptors at the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, are protective of human health and the environment in the Peripheral OU. Supplementary/confirmatory sampling done by Service personnel supported the database used by DOE and its contractor and the comprehensive risk assessment. Service sampling results were, although not always at or below background levels, well within the range of results that DOE presented in their RI-ready database.The refuge was officially established in 2007."

The Principal Investigator was Wayne M. Crayton from the Ecological Services Anchorage field office, who was assisted by Nancy Norvell and other staff from the Refuge. In 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) conducted a similar investigation on abandoned and active military facilities on Kiska, Adak, Agattu, and Great Sitkin islands (Crayton, 1990). Both investigations centered on determining what, if any, contaminants (i.e., organochlorines, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, inorganics) from military activities may have entered the surrounding refuge environment. Organochlorine compounds are normally associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides and other biological control agents. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in nature but it is the anthropogenic-derived compounds (usually petroleumrelated) that pose the greatest environmental threat. Inorganics are comprised of biologically essential (e.g. iron, zinc) and non-essential (e.g. mercury, lead) elements which typically are found in concentrations less than 1 part per million (ppm). Each project site is known to contain \"petroleum, oil, and lubricant products\" (POLs) and spills and electrical transformers which may contain PCBs. Extensive leaching of POLs and PCBs into the surrounding environment, depending on their chemical makeup and concentration, could pose a threat to fish and wildlife resources. The Service's effort to determine the presence or absence of contaminants at the abandoned facilities is necessary because there is a potential for contaminants to be transferred through the food chain to Service trust resources (migratory birds, anadromous fish). The Department of Defense has initiated a program [Defense Environmental Restoration Program (Program), P.L. 98-212,97 Stat. 1427, Dec. 8, 1983] designed to identify, evaluate, and cleanup hazardous waste sites on abandoned military bases and restore the areas to their near original state by implementing remedial actions. The Program is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund regulations. Of the five abandoned military facilities being investigated by the Service, only Tanaga Island has had a Corps-sponsored site investigation. No Corp-sponsored cleanup has occurred on any of the islands to date. Included in this report is a summary of field activities, and an interpretation of analytical data. Contaminated sites requiring remediation activities and recommendations for additional study and cleanup are also identified for use by the Refuge manager in administering the refuge."

DEFINITIONS    Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.    Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.    Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.    NOTES    Data on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).    Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.    Hierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).    The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that    1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,    where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).    County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).    SOURCES    National Center for Health Statistics.

The inventory, which was funded by the National Park Service, serves several purposes including generating information for managers to set future land protection priorities. The landscape is a mosaic of seven natural communities, including an exemplary array of five wetland types, which support over 130 bird species. The natural communities themselves are not rare in northern New Hampshire, but the combination of an undammed pond with an undeveloped shoreline and a diverse mixture of wetlands is uncommon in the State. To protect the ecological processes which have sculpted the current Refuge, and to augment the habitat types presently represented in the Refuge. future protection efforts should focus on three areas:  1.The matrix of northern hardwood-spruce-fir forest that links Little Cherry and Big Cherry Ponds.  2.

This document offers proposed refuge purposes, vision, and goals. It also presents a detailed description of the physical, biological, and socioeconomic environment within which the study takes place, thus defining the area that may be affected by a refuge. Most important, the Final EA recommends Alternative B as the preferred action for establishing a refuge in Cherry Valley. The Service believes Alternative B is the best alternative for fulfilling the intent of the Study Act, and the proposed refuge purposes, vision, and goals. In addition to the preferred action, two other reasonable alternatives are presented for comparison purposes. The three alternatives are summarized briefly below:  -Alternative A: No Refuge -- This is the \u201cNo Action\u201d alternative. It serves as a baseline to which the other alternatives are compared. In this alternative, there would be no new refuge and no designated acquisition boundary. Habitat protection and management would continue to be done by existing organizations and government programs.  -Alternative B: Cherry Valley Diverse Habitat Complex -- This is the preferred action. It proposes protection of up to 20,466 acres for a national wildlife refuge. Protection of lands would be done through fee title (about 50 percent of the acres) and conservation easements (about 50 percent of the acres). This alternative would provide protection for more extensive habitat areas, compared to Alternatives A and C, that potentially would better enable the  Service to meet the needs of both rare and more common species of wildlife.  -Alternative C: Cherry Valley Wetlands and Ridge Forests Complex -- This alternative proposes protection of up to 14,124 acres for a potential refuge.  Protection of lands would be done through fee title (about 65 percent of the acres) and conservation easements (about 35 percent of the acres). This alternative protects the most sensitive habitats and species but does not provide the connectivity and extensive habitat protection proposed in Alternative B."

                "text": "Evaluation of the source and extent of lead poisoning at Lacreek National Wildlife Refuge, Bennett County, South Dakota The presence of lead shot at levels which would warrant remediation were not identified on any of the study plots. However, trumpeter swans and at least in prior years, Canada geese both have been documented to be affected with lead poisoning. There may be several explanations why densities of lead shot were not found during the study. The methodology described by Anderson (1986) in collecting soil samples is most likely adequate to have identified spent lead shot if it was present on the sites that were surveyed. Thus, the shot may simply not have been there; it may have been buried deeply by past agricultural or water management practices; or the lead shot that geese and swans do ingest were found in areas that were not sampled. Given the distances that geese and swans fly to forage or roost, it is not practical or realistic to develop a sampling protocol that could account for all possible sites where they could encounter spent lead shot. This study attempted to narrow the potential sites by identifying areas where birds were foraging and loafing, or areas that were historically known to have had extensive hunting activity. Both these efforts proved to be unproductive in identifying potential sites for ingestion. Fields for survey were selected based on goose use, and/or hunting pressure. The majority of these were inactive agricultural practice, which includes the tillage of the soil surface. It may be that any shot present on the surface had already been incorporated into the soil profile and is currently not available to foraging geese. Even though lead shot was not found to be a problem in agricultural fields on the refuge, many refuge fields are currently being converted to native grasslands, further eliminating the potential risk of lead shot ingestion. The wetlands that were surveyed were selected based on their past history as duck hunting clubs. Thus, if there were to be any concentrations of lead in refuge wetlands, it would have been on these sites. It is quite possible that during the 65 years of refuge ownership management, the habitat has changed such that past hunting areas are no longer open areas where surveys could take place (e.g., dense stands of cattail were not surveyed due to the inaccessibility of the area to waterfowl and technicians), or the spent lead shot has been buried in sediments past the depth that was surveyed and hopefully past the depth at which swans and geese can access. While the results of this study did not identify sites where geese and swans could potentially access and ingest lead pellets, there are potentially many other sites which could provide access but were simply not surveyed."

The main objective of the survey was to assess the current status of businesses in Lesotho, in relation to four principal factors, namely, water supply and sanitation, essential health services, investment climate in the country, land administration and modernization of the commercial legal system. The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%). In contrast, most jointly-owned enterprises had acquired plots through transfer from someone for cash (32.6%), followed by public sector agency grants (26.3%).  A significant proportion (69.8%) of enterprises did not have formally registered titles/documents to the premises that they used; The top reason for opting to rent/sublease business premises was not intending to acquire land, which was mentioned by 35.1 percent of enterprises. The second reason was of enterprises that did not qualify to hold land in Lesotho, which was mentioned by 23.2 percent of enterprises Majority (67.2 percent) of enterprises did not have occupational insurance. Over 50 percent of the enterprises did not have all the policies. Workers in 83.5 percent of all enterprises did not have access to a health and safety officer.  In 88.3 and 91.7 percent of all enterprises, workers did not have access to a counselor and services of a Social Worker, respectively. Workers in 32.6 percent of all enterprises did not have break hours.  As high as 86.4 percent of the enterprises lost between one (1) and 30 days to sick leave in the last twelve months. Majority of enterprises (84.5%) provided neither educational programmes/activities nor ARVs to their workforce."

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.    Potentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.    Not all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.    Mortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.    Underlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)    Heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20\u2013I51)    Cancer (C00\u2013C97)    Unintentional injury (V01\u2013X59 and Y85\u2013Y86)    Chronic lower respiratory disease (J40\u2013J47)    Stroke (I60\u2013I69)    Locality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2013 county-based classification scheme.    Benchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.    Potentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.    Users can explore three benchmarks:    \u201c2010 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.    \u201c2005 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.    \u201cFloating\u201d is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.

                "text": "El Salvador - TVET System Reform I. Introduction    The Human Capital Project is one of three projects under the second compact, and it focuses on improving the quality of education and achieving a better match between the supply of skills and the demands of the labor market as they pertain to the international trade of goods and services in El Salvador. The Human Capital Project consists of two activities: (1) the Education Quality Activity, which is intended to improve the quality of the national education system; and (2) the Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) System Reform Activity. The TVET System Reform Activity, with funding of nearly $15 million, is intended to enhance its capacity to harmonize the skills supplied through education and training providers with the skills demanded by the labor market.     MCC contracted with Mathematica to conduct an evaluation of the activities under the Human Capital Project, including the TVET System Reform Activity. Mathematica will conduct a performance evaluation of the TVET System Reform Activity to document its implementation and assess how successful the project was at achieving the intended outcomes. Lessons learned through this performance evaluation will be useful for stakeholders as they continue improving the TVET system, and to inform decisions about the potential expansion of the reform activities to other sectors beyond the sectors focalized by FOMILENIO II.  II. Overview of the Technical  Education and Professional Training System  (TEPT) Activity The revised implementation of this Activity encompasses two main sub activities:     1. Integrated Technical Education and Professional Training Systems Sub-Activity: The revised implementation plan for this sub-activity includes two strategies:         a. Capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. The capacity building strategy has two goals: the first is to enable the private and public sector to identify and manage demands for technical education and professional training. The second is to enable public sector stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of education and training programs to respond quickly and efficiently to private sector labor market demands.     b. Strengthen the link between the supply and demand of technical education and professional training  through the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of information within and between productive sectors , and between private and public institutions in all productive sectors. FOMILENIO II will support the development of sectoral diagnostics to identify the needs of the productive sector, and improve the match between the industries and the training offerings in specified geographic areas. The following are the main tasks for implementing this strategy: 1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; 2) design or update three optional modules of the BTVs with input from the Sectoral Committees; and 3) Establish agreements between companies from the productive sectors and MINED to offer internships for students.    2. Continuous Labor Demand Assessment Sub-Activity. Two strategies encompass the implementation of this sub-activity: 1) establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework; and 2) strengthen the labor market observatory, integrating existing efforts to track labor market conditions.  III. Logic Model    The TEPT Activity in El Salvador is designed to link activities in the systems of technical education and professional training to the needs of the labor market in order to close the gap between training and employment. To that end, TEPT activities are largely focused on facilitating the exchange of information between the supply side and the demand side, both within and between productive sectors. The theory of change behind the implementation of the TEPT Activity states that all of its outputs will increase companies' productivity, and thereby improve workers' wages as well as the employability and socioeconomic standing of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.    1. Activities    The TEPT Activity funded by FOMILENIO II aims to strengthen capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. To that end, this strategy includes (1) creating sectoral committees for technical and educational training, and creating a Sectoral Committee Board to consolidate the demand for professional development in the private sector; (2) offering professional training to workers in the different industrial sectors under the competency-based approach; (3) designing models for certifying workers by competencies and accrediting institutions; (4) creating a Coordination Council of Technical Education and Professional Training to facilitate coordination between public and private organizations involved in technical and professional training, and align the offerings to the skills demanded in the labor market; and (5) establishing procedures and regulations to strengthen the institutional capacity to meet the private sector's demand for technical education and professional training. Implementation of the TEPT Activity includes the design of a roadmap for creating a national qualifications framework, and the development of an information system for the Coordination Council and other bodies to use in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the TEPT Activity.    The TEPT activity also seeks to improve the link between labor demand in the productive sectors with the availability of technical education and vocational training. To achieve this goal, FOMILENIO II plans to: (1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; (2) design at least three modules for the Vocational Technical Baccalaureate in coordination with the Sectoral Committees; and (3) establish agreements between companies from the sectors and MINEDUCYT to offer internships for students.     2. Short- and medium-term outcomes    Once the sectoral committees and the Board of Sectoral Committees are in existence, and a model for certification and accreditation has been implemented, the private sector will improve its capacity to identify and influence the professional training that is available to prospective trainees. Designing modules for the Professional Technical Baccalaureate, and creating the Coordination Council of TEPT will also improve the linkage between the demands of the productive sector, and the availability of technical education and vocational training.     3. Long-term outcomes    In the long term, the TEPT Activity is expected to improve the government's capacity to plan and evaluate the offer of technical education and professional training assisted by the MNC and the information system developed for subsequent planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the improved match between labor demand in the industrial/private sectors and the technical training available to the potential workforce will improve the productivity of companies, and therefore increase workers' wages. It is also expected to improve the employability of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.  IV. Evaluation design    The aims of the performance evaluation are to (1) assess progress toward the short- and medium-term outcomes that the program was designed to achieve and (2) understand and document the implementation of the Technical Education and Professional Training activities. To meet these two overarching aims, the performance evaluation will include a pre-post analysis of program outcomes and an implementation study.    A. Pre-post design.    The single group pre-post design consists of obtaining data for the outcomes of interest prior to (or at the beginning of) TEPT training (pre) and the same measure after participation in the TEPT courses (post). The pre-post study will focus on measuring the changes on labor market outcomes, and assessing to what extent work conditions, wages, and employment status improved for those who participated in the TEPT programs.     B. Implementation study     The implementation study will focus on describing all components of the TEPT program and their operation and identifying progress towards short- and medium-term outcomes of the program. We will document how program components were implemented, explore the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation of TEPT sub-activities, and describe the main program outputs of the TEPT System. We will also identify short- and long-term achievements and sustainability efforts related to each TEPT sub-activity.  V. Evaluation research questions    The pre-post study will focus on three descriptive research questions:    1. Did employee work conditions, benefits or non-wage compensation, change for trainees who participated in the TEPT courses approximately six to nine months after the courses ended?     2. Did wages change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    3. Did employment status change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    We will examine five main overarching research questions through the implementation study:    1. How were the TEPT sub-activities implemented, and what were the major facilitators and barriers to implementation?    2. Were some sectors more successful implementing the TEPT activities than others?    3. Which outputs were accomplished for each sub-activity, and to what extent did they meet the targets?     4. Which short- and long-term outcomes were accomplished for each sub-activity?     5. What are the plans for the institutional and financial sustainability of the services offered and the entities created as part of the TEPT activity?  VI. Data sources and analysis plan    A. Pre-post study:     Data sources.     The primary data source for the performance evaluation will be the trainee tracer survey. In collaboration with FOMILENIO II, we will field the pre-training tracer survey (baseline) with about 500 participants who are enrolled in TEPT courses, either prior to or within one month of their course initiation. TEPT courses will be rolled out starting the second quarter of 2019. Because the timing for the rollout will vary, baseline data collection will take place on a rolling basis and will be aligned with the course rollout plan for the prioritized sectors. We plan to conduct the baseline survey as a Computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ) with groups of enrolled trainees at their training sites and the follow-up survey as an individual, face-to-face, computer-administered questionnaire at respondents' work sites or homes. We will collect the follow-up survey six to nine months after the course ends by following a staggered timeline similar to the baseline data collection. The follow-up survey is expected to start in mid-2020 and to extend beyond the compact period.     Analyses.     To assess changes in work conditions, wages, and employment status sometime after participants should have completed the TEPT training programs, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the tracer survey data for trainees in FOMILENIO II-supported courses. We will compare key outcome indicators at baseline and follow-up for each trainee-level outcome and report averages (mean percent change) for the full sample of trainees and also by gender. We will also describe the background trainee characteristics, such as gender, age, and education level. The analysis will include a cross-sector comparison of participant characteristics and implementation milestones.    B. Implementation study    Data sources.     We will draw on three sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on outputs and achievements of the TEPT activity: (1) stakeholder interviews, (2) program monitoring data, and (3) a document review.     Analyses.     a. Analytic approach for quantitative program implementation data. We will conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on monitoring data to summarize the program outputs and understand short-term and long-term program achievements.    b. Analytic approach for qualitative program implementation data. We will prepare interview and focus group transcripts and conduct thematic analysis in two sequential steps. The first step involves conducting data reduction and mapping transcript segments to the core performance research questions. The second step involves thematic framing-the process of distilling themes and identifying patterns in qualitative data. We will develop a coding framework with a hierarchy of conceptual categories that are linked to the research questions and the program logic model. We will also create thematic memos for data synthesis and interpretation of key findings.     To take advantage of the complementarity that a mixed-methods approach affords, we will integrate findings from descriptive quantitative analysis of monitoring and administrative data with findings from qualitative data sources. We will summarize program outputs and outcomes from FOMILENIO II's administrative records and implementation reports by using data abstraction templates that we will design for this study. We will also create summary tables of qualitative findings from key stakeholder interviews. Then, we will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings by using triangulation techniques to (1) assess the consistency of the findings across methods and data sources, (2) confirm patterns of findings, and (3) identify potential discrepancies across data sources. Furthermore, information from the qualitative data collection related to barriers and facilitators to program implementation will help us interpret the findings from the quantitative analysis."

This Sensible, Latent and Ground Heat Flux composite was formed from three data sources: the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) Energy Balance/Bowen Ratio (EBBR) sites, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD) Little Washita Watershed site, and the ARM SGP Eddy Correlation (ECOR) sites. Data from 14 ARM/EBBR stations, 1 NOAA/ATDD station, and 8 ARM/ECOR stations were merged to form this composite. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) did not do any quality control on the data set. Heat flux sensors consist of a differential temperature sensor which measures heat flow. Heat flux is a vector quantity of energy flowing through a 1 meter square surface in one second. Sensible heat flux is the transfer of sensible heat between the surface and the air, or vice versa. Latent heat flux is the transfer of latent heat (heat released or absorbed by water) between the surface and the air, or vice versa. Ground, or soil, heat flux is the transfer of sensible heat in the soil, either toward the surface or away from the surface. The Little Washita site records only 1 soil heat flux value. The EBBR sites record soil heat flux values from 5 different sensors. The ARM soil sensors are located in a half-circle approximately 2 meters in diameter under the net radiometer, which extends to the south about 1 meter from the EBBR frame. The soil conditions at the EBBR sites are varied from very sandy soil to very clay-laden soil. However, all of the sensors for one particular EBBR site are in the same soil type. Information on the soil characteristics at each of the ARM Soil Water and Temperature System (SWATS) sites (which are located nearby the ARM EBBR sites) is available as part of the ARM/GCIP NESOB-97. (These include the \"Organic Carbon and Matter\", \"Soil Texture\", \"Parameters for Soil Water Retention Models\", \"Bulk Density\", Particle Size\", and \"Soil Water Retention\" data sets). The EBBR sites also record Bowen Ratio, home_15 and home_30 values, as well, whereas the Little Washita site does not.

This Radiation Composite was formed from five data    sources: (1) the 25m ARM/Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) Multi-Filter Radiometer (MFR) 20 second data of Upwelling Longwave and Shortwave Irradiance; (2) the Solar and Infrared Radiation Observing System (SIROS) 20 second data of Upwelling and Downwelling Longwave and Shortwave Irradiance, which changed over to (3) the Solar Infrared Station (SIRS) 20 second data of Upwelling and Downwelling Longwave and Shortwave Irradiance; (4) the Broadband Solar Radiation Network (BSRN) 1 minute data of Downwelling Longwave and Shortwave Irradiance; and (5) the High Plains Climate Network (HPCN) hourly Solar Radiation data. This composite was developed by the merging of the 30-minute averaged values of Irradiance as derived by University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) from the 20-second values provided by ARM for its 25m MFR station and its SIROS and SIRS stations; the 30-minute averaged values of Irradiance as derived by UCAR/JOSS from the 1-minute values provided by ARM for its BSRN station; and the hourly values provided by HPCN. UCAR/JOSS computed standard deviations for the averaged irradiance data when at least 15 observations were available within the 30-minute averaging interval. JOSS did not do any other quality control on the data set. This radiation composite    contains data within the NESOB 1997 domain (100.5W to 94.5W longitude and 34N to 39N latitude) and  time period (01 April 1997 through 31 March 1998). The ARM/GCIP NESOB-97 Shortwave and Longwave Radiation Composite Dataset contains eight metadata parameters and twelve data parameters and flags. The metadata parameters describe the date, time, network, station and location at which the data were collected. Data values are valid for the 30 minutes preceding the time of observation, and all times are UTC. The data parameters have an associated QC flag but the University Corporation    for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) does not Quality Control the data at the present time. The Quality Control flag is set to \"U\" for \"Unchecked\", unless the datum is missing, in which case the flag is set to \"M\".

                "text": "Identification of Spatial Fault Patterns in Semiconductor Wafers Abstract  The semiconductor industry is constantly searching for new ways to increase the rate of both process development and yield learning.  As more data is being collected and stored throughout the chip manufacturing process, it has become increasingly more difficult to analyze yield signals using traditional statistical methods.  Most of the serious yield issues manifest themselves as non-random electrical failure maps. Our semi-supervised fault    detection framework has elements of Spatial Signature Analysis (SSA) to capture yield signals for very large datasets without losing the critical details typically involved with summarization techniques.  It includes signature detection, de-noising, clustering, and purification that allow one to create a true spatial response metric of the yield issue. Once this has been accomplished, one can load process data to join with the spatial    response and invoke customized rule induction algorithms that generate a set of hypotheses - likely process causes for a specific spatial target response.  The framework has been successfully used at Intel and represents an example of the growing influence of modern statistical learning in the semiconductor industry.  Speaker:  Dr. Eugene Tuv, Intel  Dr. Eugene Tuv is a Senior Staff Research Scientist in the Logic Technology Department at Intel. His research interests include supervised and unsupervised non-parametric machine learning with massive heterogeneous data.

We located 239,571 unique publications with the search terms: cotton OR Gossypium. A search of these records using the term \u201ccover crop\u201d resulted in 424 publications, composed of refereed articles, conference proceedings, research reports, and bulletins. With examination of these 424 eligible publications, 320 were excluded because they met our exclusion criteria: means for cover crop or no-cover crop treatments were not included, cotton yield or weed growth were not reported, article was a duplicate, article did not contain primary data (review or book), or they were not obtainable using interlibrary loan services (five articles). We did not include intercropping (cover crops grown simultaneously with cotton) studies, nor did we include studies that used weed count as the response variable. For the weed biomass effect size (ES), if an experiment included both weed and weed-free fallow no-cover-crop controls, we used the weed fallow no-cover-crop control in our analysis. If an experiment included herbicides applied over all treatments in season, we excluded the weed biomass ES but included the cotton biomass ES. We identified 104 articles that met our screening criteria (a full citation list and details of primary studies are provided in the supplemental material). Papers spanned 48 yr and were in English and Portuguese languages.    Treatment means and number of replications (sample sizes) were collected for each study. For publications reporting means for more than one no-cover-crop (control) treatment in a nonfactorial experiment, we used the no-cover-crop control that most closely approximated the cover crop treatment. If replications were given as a range, we used the smallest value. For studies that did not report number of replications, we used n = 1 unless LSD or SEs were provided, in which case we used n = 2. If data were provided in graphical form, means were extracted using WebPlotDigitizer (Rogatgi, 2011).    Multiple treatment combinations from one article were treated as independent studies (also referred to as trials or paired observations in the meta-analysis literature) and represented individual units in the meta-analysis. For example, Ashworth et al. (2018) and Li et al. (2013) examined the effects of two cover crop species over 3 yr, resulting in six studies from that article for lint yield ES. Vasilakoglou et al. (2011) studied control of three weed genera by four varieties of one cover crop species, resulting in 12 studies for the weed control ES. Although, the use of multiple studies from one publication has the disadvantage of increasing the dependence among studies that are assumed to be independent (Gurevitch and Hedges, 1999), the greater number of studies maximizes the meta-analysis\u2019 statistical power (Lajeuness and Forbes, 2003). This approach has been used often in agricultural and plant biology meta-analyses (Mayerhofer et al., 2013; McGrath and Lobell, 2013; Ferraretto and Shaver, 2015). Therefore, we derived 1117 studies from 104 articles. As in prior meta-analyses (Ashworth et al., 2018; Mayerhofer et al., 2013), we used the final time point in the meta-analysis for studies that included data for multiple time points in one season. One exception was weed control, as an article used in this meta-analysis reported means that were recorded at three time points during the season (Norsworthy et al., 2010). Considering that each year of an experiment provides varying growing conditions only weakly correlated with other years (repeated measures across years is not needed in our experience), we considered each year as an independent study in the meta-analysis."

                "text": "Alaska Moose Monitoring Workshop, Final Report Moose are vitally important to Alaska\u2019s subsistence and recreational hunters, wildlife viewers and economy. Both the State of Alaska and federal government are mandated to manage moose populations. Specific information needs vary across the state, but the ability to monitor the size, trend, and composition of moose populations is fundamental to sound, scientific management.  Moose population monitoring (including measures of abundance, composition, and trend) in Alaska has routinely involved aerial surveys flown in the fall and early winter, prior to antler drop, when sexes can be distinguished. These surveys rely on complete snow cover to optimize sightability. Over the past decade, delayed onset of snowfall has crippled biologists\u2019 ability to monitor moose populations using existing protocols, especially in coastal regions.  Two additional factors create challenges for moose population monitoring. First, changes in Alaska\u2019s human population, moose harvest patterns, and agency legal mandates have altered the types and amounts of information managers need to inform decisions regarding hunting seasons, bag limits, allocation among user groups, and predator management. Second, state and federal agency budgets for monitoring moose populations are static or declining.  To address these challenges, the Wildlife Management Institute (WMI) collaborated with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the National Park Service (NPS) to convene the Alaska Moose Monitoring Workshop in Anchorage on April 24 and 25, 2018. The workshop brought together over 70 managers, researchers, and biometricians from the sponsoring agencies, as well as invited speakers from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Mount Holyoke College, and Environment Yukon to address challenges to monitoring moose populations. Major financial support for the workshop was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through the Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative. Additional support was provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and Wildlife Management Institute."

In conjunction, the current availability of methylmercury (the form of mercury toxic to animals and humans) in aquatic ecosystems is at levels posing risks to human and ecological health. Risk levels vary considerably in response to methylmercury availability, which is affected by lake hydrology, biogeochemistry, habitat, topography, and proximity to airborne sources. The Common Loon was selected as a suitable bioindicator of aquatic mercury toxicity, based on ecological, logistical, and other criteria, including public valuations of natural resources. In New York State, loons were sampled opportunistically in the Adirondack Park from 1998-2000. Based on risk categories developed from the literature and in situ studies by BioDiversity Research Institute and their collaborators, 17% of the breeding loon population in New York is estimated to be at risk from mercury contamination. Loons in the high risk categories were captured on acidic, low alkalinity lakes in the Adirondack Park that had low levels of dissolved organic carbon. As has been found elsewhere in the Northeast, blood mercury levels in adult birds were higher than those in juvenile loons, and adult male loons had higher blood and feather mercury levels than did females. Higher blood and feather mercury levels in male loons reflect both the ability of females to depurate mercury into eggs and the tendency of males to eat larger fish than females. The results of the sampling efforts in New York are coordinated with contaminant sampling in loons throughout the Northeast to better assess the neurologic, behavioral, and physical impacts of mercury toxicity on loons. Population models based on related studies in the Northeast indicate that mercury toxicity has potential to negatively impact breeding loon populations by reducing overall reproductive success. Thus, in New York, it is recommended that population monitoring and contaminant sampling of breeding loons continue through the efforts of the newly established Adirondack Cooperative Loon Program. Such population monitoring programs and continued refinement of population models enable the early detection of declining population trends and the implementation of management efforts, as well as assisting in state and national policies and regulations that reflect the ecological injury mercury is currently having on the freshwater landscape. Results of blood lead levels from loons sampled in New York from 1998-2000 are still pending. Dead loons found by the general public were forwarded to the NYS Wildlife Pathology Laboratory for necropsy analysis. Lead toxicity due to the ingestion of lead fishing tackle accounted for 20% of the mortality in loons necropsied by the NYS Wildlife Pathology Laboratory. Currently, legislation is under consideration in New York to regulate the sale and use of lead fishing tackle. Passage of these bills would eventually reduce the quantity of lead sinkers deposited in New York waterbodies, which should significantly decrease the chances of waterbirds, such as loons, ingesting lead sinkers and developing lead toxicity."

The activity also included a services component comprised of nurse training, public health management, and waste management.   Originally half of the health centers were assigned to treatment and half to the control. However, due to other donors' activities, construction sequencing and budgetary considerations, only 59 of the 138 HC were included in the impact evaluation. Thirty-one health centers, including three high need health centers, were assigned to the treatment group, and 28 health centers were assigned to the control group. All but the 3 high need health centers were assigned randomly to each group. To enhance precision, treatment and control health centers were then clustered by need and eco-region and matched to one another. The evaluation used a randomized rollout design whereby the treatment group would receive the intervention early and the control group would receive the intervention later.  The ART Clinics activity aimed to improve infrastructure in outpatient departments (OPDs) in 14 hospitals through rehabilitation and/or construction, provision of power, water, and telecommunications equipment, and medical equipment and instruments and clinical furniture.   Since randomization was not feasible for this activity, the evaluation design originally called for a two-way evaluation that used both difference-in-difference and before-and-after estimation techniques. This approach would have allowed NORC to estimate outcomes and, in a subset of indicators, cross-validate results, in order to have the most reliable possible assessment of the effect of the OPD intervention. This evaluation design assumed that 5 OPDs, the minimum number required to provide a quasi-experimental design with acceptable statistical power, would serve as controls. However, there are only 16 OPDs in Lesotho, which meant that only 2 OPDs will serve as controls. Hence, the final proposal was that NORC use only the before-and-after estimator, supported by qualitative data to fill in gaps and interpret unexpected findings.  Ultimately, the randomized rollout design that was developed for the Lesotho Health Centers was rendered infeasible due to infrastructure delays.  Before pursuing an alternative methodology, MCC and the evaluator revisited the underlying logic and targeted outcomes for the Health Project and determined that compact-supported infrastructure, which was the focus of the exisiting evaluation contract and designs for Health Centers and OPDs, could not be evaluated in isolation.  MCC opted to cancel that contract and pursue a more comprehensive approach to evaluating the entire Health Project.  Four separate sets of data were collected before the original evaluation was canceled: two short surveys (a survey of facility staff and an exit interview of patients) and two types of administrative data (register of patients undergoing anti-retroviral therapy and monthly summary of all outpatients)."

Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5.   The 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.  The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:     + TMI (TRMM)    + GMI, (GPM)    + SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)    + AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)    + MHS (NOAA 18,19)     + MHS (METOP A,B)    + ATMS (NPP)    + SAPHIR (MT1)  This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.   The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty."

Water quality data was associated with known and potential paddlefish Polyodon spathula habitats. As a part of this study, paddlefish were also sampled on three different occasions in 2011 from the Bluff Lake spillways to assess use of the spillway areas and acquire broodstock for spawning at the Private John Allen National Fish Hatchery. Progeny from the spawned fish were used in experiments to determine lower tolerance of paddlefish to dissolved oxygen concentrations. In addition, in order to determine if paddlefish were spawning, egg traps were placed in both spillways of Bluff Lake and in one location in the Noxubee River.The overall purpose of the data collection was to assist the USFWS by providing baseline data for the locations sampled, and to understand management options for the American paddlefish Polyodon spathula with respect to water quality at the Noxubee Refuge. It was found that a large number of paddlefish were present primarily below the radial gate spillway in the late winter to spring, presumably due to deep water, high flows and high dissolved oxygen. Interestingly, paddlefish were not present in very high numbers in the spring of the following year (2012), presumably due to less winter precipitation and lower flows on both the Noxubee River system and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. On the Noxubee Refuge, sampling for eggs was unsuccessful, possibly due to reductions or cessation of flow through the radial gate spillway near the time of expected spawning of paddlefish. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were high early in the year in all areas sampled but declined to low levels by the late summer3period due to higher temperatures and reduced water flow. It was determined that Halbert Lake has potentially high quality habitat for juvenile paddlefish, due to the proximity to presumable spawning areas and high concentrations of plankton, but dissolved oxygen is too low during the summer to support paddlefish when this oxbow lake loses connection to Oktoc Creek from receding water levels.Future management of paddlefish on the Refuge would benefit from regular late winter to spring assessment of paddlefish use of the Bluff Lake spillways and further work to determine if spawning is occurring in this area through the use of egg traps. Further knowledge of paddlefish movements would also be beneficial to establish the timing of spawning movements and the seasonal locations of paddlefish. Management recommendations are to maintain at least some level of water flow through the radial gate spillway through the late spring to ensure that paddlefish do not leave the area prior to spawning, and so that eggs and larvae can receive adequate flow for oxygenation and drift to downstream nursery habitats. Halbert Lake offers potential habitat for drifting larval and juvenile life stages, but connectivity with Oktoc Creek must be enhanced to prevent low dissolved oxygen levels."

Within this xeric landscape, legume density and species richness are maximized in small, topographic depressions known as bean dips and pea swales. Major indices of fertility are enhanced in these depressions, and productivity decreases withincreasing elevation. Legumes show patterns of sorting along these complex topographic gradients. In the Carolina Sandhills, twenty transects were established along slopes of depressions. Legume stem density, soil texture and chemistry, and relative elevation were measured at regular intervals. Although some legumes occurred most frequently on the upper slopes of depressions, most were confined to mesic bottoms. To clarify these findings, seeds and seedlings of select legume species were introduced to the gradient, and their performance was evaluated over one growing season. The number of germinated seeds surviving one growing season did not differ across the gradient for any single species, but differences between species were observed. Biomass also differed significantly between species, and was nearly twice as great in bottom plots for all but one species. These results provide a valuable supplement to the understanding of a unique community that deserves conservation priority. Restoration of degraded loamy soil communities could be guided by these findings."

Key findings include:  Improved Service Delivery Platform    *Crucial health infrastructure was built or rehabilitated and equipped for use, including 138 health centers (HCs) and 14 outpatient departments (OPDs), though with significant delays and required substantial complementary investment from the Government of Lesotho.     Consensus suggests that the Project provided a necessary platform for health service delivery throughout the country. However, many new HCs lack sufficient space to meet increasing demand, and concerns about the quality of construction and equipment persist. National Reference Lab and Blood Transfusion Services have increased their operations, though budgetary factors constrain their full service expansion.  Patient and Staff Perceptions    Patient satisfaction with and use of the facilities has increased, though barriers still exist for pregnant women and people in peripheral communities.  Staff levels and satisfaction with their living and working conditions have improved. Yet budget constraints keep more than a quarter of sampled health facilities staffed below the current five-nurse staffing complement, especially in hard-to-reach areas.  Progress toward Health Outcomes    Findings indicate that most population-level health outcomes will require more time to materialize, contrary to MCC's expectations at the outset, though trends in health care use and improvements in some health-related indicators are encouraging."

Thirty-four permanent intensive study plots (30 x 4 m) were established to quantify the effects of this disturbance and to study recovery rates. Sixty-eight photo-trend plots (10 x 4 m) were sampled less intensively to assess a wider variety of sites. Study plots were selected to represent the range of disturbance which occurred in each of 7 major vegetation types. Vegetation type, disturbance levels, and soil profiles were described for each plot. Ice contents in the top 30 em of permafrost were measured and found to be highly variable within and between plots, ranging from 2 to 58%. The 1 and 2-year-old trails were generally visible in all vegetation types. Visibility improved slightly between 1984 and 1985 on some plots due to weathering of litter and soil to a lighter color, the lack of water on trails in 1985, and an increase in standing dead leaves on trails. Plant cover was generally lower on disturbed plots than on adjacent control plots. Little recovery of plant cover occurred between 1984 and 1985. Disturbance caused only small increases in exposed soil at most plots; statistically significant increases in exposed soil occurred most often on plots with high micro-relief (tussocks, hummocks, and polygon rims). Bare patches were mainly recolonized by vegetative shoots, but seedlings were common at a few plots. Graminoids were the most important recolonizers in most vegetation types, except for riparian shrubland and Dryas terrace where shrubs were the most important. Overall, recolonizing shoots made up only a small percentage of ground cover, and bare patches changed little in appearance between 1984 and 1985. Plant productivity, as measured by mass of ~ants, twig length of shrubs, and number of leaves per sedge plant, was generally higher on disturbed plots than on adjacent controls. Statistically significant changes in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations occurred in some plant species on disturbed plots. Significantly greater thaw depths were found in nearly half of all study plots. Only 4 plots had increased differences between disturbed and control measurements in 1985 compared to 1984. Measurable track depression (5-12 em) occurred on 4 plots, which were all on narrow trails in moist sedge-shrub tundra."

We performed a common garden weed seed burial study at the University of Illinois Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Savoy, IL (40.048757 N, -88.237206 E), from October 2007 through October 2012. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications of the sub-plot variable species nested within main plot variable burial duration (1 to 5 years). Eleven annual weed species were included, spanning a broad range of seed sizes, dormancy types and seedbank persistence: Abutilon theophrasti Medik (velvetleaf), Ambrosia trifida L. (giant ragweed), Amaranthus tuberculatus [Moq]. Sauer (common waterhemp), Bassia scoparia [L.] A. J. Scott (kochia), Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters), Ipomoea hederacea Jacq. (ivyleaf morningglory), Panicum miliaceum L. (wild proso millet), Polygonum pensylvanicum L. (Pennsylvania smartweed), Setaria faberi Herrm. (giant foxtail), Setaria pumila [Poir] Roem. (yellow foxtail) and Thlaspi arvense L. (field pennycress).    Weed seeds were collected in 2007 from the experimental site and adjoining fields by gently shaking mature inflorescences over a bucket and bulking seeds from multiple plants to form a composite sample for each species. Light seed were removed by processing with a seed cleaner, after which seeds were stored in air tight containers at 4C until burial. Immediately prior to burial, seed viability was assayed with tetrazolium. Burial units consisted of 100 seeds of a given species placed in the bottom of a 2.5 cm deep square tray, 10 cm on a side, made of 0.5 mm stainless steel wire mesh. Tray bottoms were permeable to water, but prevented seeds from escaping. Trays were filled 2 cm deep with soil from a nearby grass sward that had not been cropped for over 30 years, to avoid contamination with weed seeds (verified by elutriating samples of this soil). Within each experimental unit, we excavated a 2 cm deep rectangle 30 cm wide by 40 cm long, and placed trays for each of the 11 species side by side into this depression so that their soil surface was flush with the surrounding soil, leaving a 0.5 cm wire mesh lip exposed in each tray. Each experimental unit was covered by wire mesh with 1 cm square openings to permit access to invertebrate granivores. The study plot was fenced to exclude large vertebrates.    Seedling emergence was recorded weekly from March through October every year. Seed trays for a given burial duration treatment were removed in October of the assigned year and seeds recovered via elutriation (Wiles et al. 1996). Recovered seeds were incubated under oscillating temperature conditions (15 C/dark for 10 hr, 25 C/light for 14 hr) for 2 weeks and germination recorded. Ungerminated seeds assessed as viable through tetrazolium testing were considered dormant.    SEED TRAITS    We measured chemical and physical seed traits on freshly collected seeds following the methods outlined in Tiansawat et al. (2014), using multiple measures of each trait class to provide functional redundancy and allow them to be treated as latent or manifest variables during multivariate analyses. For the chemical defense trait class we measured ortho-dihydroxyphenol (o-DHP) concentration, abundance and diversity of phenolic compounds quantified with high performance liquid chromatography, impact of seed homogenate on brine shrimp survival, and seed removal by invertebrate granivores. Physical traits measured included seed coat thickness, seed mass, and seed coat rupture force. Pairwise interspecific phylogenetic distances were quantified using the phydist subroutine of Phylocom 4.2 (www.phylodiversity.net). Also included is a list of references from the associated literature review."

Water quality data indicated that releases from the sewage treatment plant were the likely source of elevated concentrations of nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria at several stations on Hollis Creek. These elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria could potentially cause an outbreak of disease (e.g. salmonella poisoning and avian botulism) in waterfowl populations using the wetlands adjacent to Hollis Creek within the boundary of the refuge. Dissolved oxygen levels were also severely depressed at station 3 on Hollis Creek during several periods in 1999. Organochlorine compounds were not detected in the sediment samples. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, and chromium were above predator protection levels in fish samples from Hollis Creek within the refuge. The sources of PCB, mercury, and chromium contamination in the fish samples were not determined. Organochlorine compounds (dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, p,p'DDE) were elevated in wood duck samples. Organochlorine compounds were detected at low levels in raccoon tissue samples. All metal concentrations in sediment samples were less than the appropriate level of concern with the exception of mercury. Mercury was elevated in one of the sediment samples from site 2 just below the sewage plant outfall.

Analyses of fish blood plasma revealed that endocrine disruption had occurred in over fifty percent of the fish collected. Further studies are required to determine whether the endocrine disruption is caused by releases from the sewage treatment plant or from contaminants detected in the fish. Analyses of the wood duck and raccoon blood plasma indicated that endocrine disruption was not occurring in the wood ducks and raccoons collected from the refuge.

The historic range of CMS likely was more extensive than the current restricted distribution, and logging of high-elevation red spruce forests during the early 1900s has been suggested as the most likely cause of CMS population declines. Remaining populations are geographically isolated and small in size and thus are subject to detrimental effects of genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and environmental stochasticity. Anthropogenic pressures on these populations include habitat modifications, especially those that remove the forest canopy, and habitat fragmentation. The effects of roads remain a concern for managers responsible for protecting CMS populations and their habitats. Areas in the CVNWR where CMS are known to exist (Bald Knob, Cabin Knob) are crisscrossed with old logging roads. These roads, although closed to vehicular and foot traffic during the summer, are used as cross-country ski trails during the winter. On 17 August 2006, rock transects were installed in the study area between 4319083.25010801m N, 637479.36468162m E and 4319083.25010801m N, 637455.8626923 lm E. The use of these rocks by CMS for cover will be investigated beginning in spring 2007. The primary result of this project will determine if Cheat Mountain salamanders will cross the ''unsuitable habitat\" of a logging road which has been modified by placing artificial cover objects. It is expected that within 2 years of monitoring, at least one CMS will be found under one of the rocks placed in the middle of the road. Furthermore, it is expected that more CMS will be found under rocks in the 1-m spacing transect than in the other two transects. If at least one CMS is found using a rock in the road for cover, it will be assumed that the salamander was able to cross at least some length of inhospitable road habitat. Furthermore, finding at least one CMS under a rock in the road will lend support to the continued use of artificial cover objects to mitigate negative road effects and promote dispersal by CMS. If this study is successful, it may lead managers and researchers to investigate the efficacy of other road-effect mitigation efforts such as building a boardwalk, placing a matrix of boards or logs across the road, etc. Furthermore, finding that a CMS will cross at least some distance of road habitat may lead researchers to investigate the possibility that CMS readily cross roads where no artificial cover objects have been placed."

The pool is home to a unique species of desert pupfish Cyprinodon Diabolis that is listed as endangered. The population feeds and reproduces on a slightly submerged rock ledge. In 1952, a 16.2 hectare tract of land containing Devils Hole was incorporated into the Death Valley National Monument as a detached management area. The area is currently a part of Death Valley National Park. In the late 1960's and early 1970's irrigation pumping in Ash Meadows lowered the Devils Hole pool level and the pupfish were threatened with extinction. In 1973 the U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction from pumping that would lower the pool level more than 0.91 meters below the datum. The injunction was made permanent by the U.S. District Court and upon appeal the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decision. In 1978 the U.S. District Court issued a permanent injunction to limit pumping to maintain a daily mean water level of 0.82 meters below the datum based on scientific studies. Water levels recovered in response to reduction and ultimately to cessation of pumping in Ash Meadows. By 1988 the pool level had recovered to about 0.3 meters below the pre-pumping level when it began to decline again. Concerns were raised that in the intermediate to long-term future the pool level would fall below the court mandated minimum level. Principle potential stresses causing long-term stage changes are considered to be regional ground-water pumping and changes in recharge. Water levels are measured in the pool on a continuous basis to monitor trends in water levels and to protect the endangered pupfish."

In North Carolina the peat is in 4 separate deposits located west, northwest, and north of Elizabeth City. In a few in filled channels the peat is up to 12 ft thick but most of the peat lies in broad shallow depressions and increases in thickness from Oft at the margins to 6 to 8 ft in the interior of the deposits. The deposits in North Carolina occupy an area of 76,800 acres (120 sq mi) containing about 68 million tons of moisture-free peat. The deposits greater than 4 ft thick occupy an area of 34,700 acres containing about 43 million tons of peat. The peat 1 ies to the east of the Suffolk Scarp on the Pamlico Terrace. The surface elevation of the peat ranges from 15 to 20 ft. Two main types of peat are present: (1) a brown, decomposed fibrous peat usually found at the base of the thicker peats, and (2) a black, fine-grained, highly decomposed peat that usually overlies the fibrous peat. Both peat types contain large amounts of wood. The moisture content ranges from 40 to 94% with an average of about 81% and usually increases with depth and total thickness of the peat. Away from the margins and bottoms of the deposits, the average ash content is about 7%. Heat values for moisture-free, low ash peats range from 8700 to 10,900 Btu/lb with a median of 10,100. The sulfur content ranges from 0.2 to 0.7% with a    median of 0.3%."

Marked recoveries of seabirds and other bird populations have been recorded after the removal or natural disappearance of foxes on certain islands. To restore breeding habitat for waterfowl and seabirds, the Alaska Maritime NWR plans to eradicate arctic and red foxes on 40 islands located in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Gulf of Alaska units of the refuge. Over a period of many years refuge personnel contemplate using traps, firearms, cyanide projectiles (M-44 & M-50), and toxic drop baits to eliminate introduced foxes. Use of compound 1080 and strychnine is planned for larger islands in the Aleutians, where no other indigenous terrestrial mammals exist. Trapping and shooting in conjunction with the use of cyanide devices would occur on islands off the Alaska Peninsula and on some of the smaller islands in the Aleutians. A biological control technique using sterile red foxes as an agent against introduced arctic fox also is being evaluated in the Aleutians. Use of chemical sterilants and epizootics would not be feasible. Environmental consequences from trapping and shooting would be negligible. Use of cyanide projectiles would slightly increase the risks to river otters and other non-target species, mainly off the Alaska Peninsula. Employment of toxic baits, the most efficient eradication means, would pose minor risks to eagles and other non-target species in the Aleutians, but the long term benefits in increased bird populations would greatly offset any short term losses in non-target species."

Trails were generally less visible than in the initial seasons following disturbance, however most trails remained visible or slightly visible in 1988. Less disturbed trails in wet graminoid and moist sedge-shrub tundra showed the greatest recovery in visibility with many trails no longer visible, while trails with high levels of disturbance remained easily visible due to increased flowering of cottongrass or standing water on the trail. Plant cover was measured on trails and in adjacent control plots, and compared with data from the initial years after disturbance. Moist sedge-shrub tundra and dryas terrace communities showed the largest initial dissimilarities between trails and adjacent control areas, and were thus the least resistant to disturbance. Tundra plant communities generally showed little resilience in the four or five years following disturbance, but recovery of individual species occurred in some plots. The sedges Carex aguatilis and Eriophorum angustifolium, increased above control levels on trails in moist sedge-shrub tundra. Deciduous and evergreen shrub cover initially decreased on most trails with recovery occurring by 1988 at a few plots in most vegetation types. Cover of mosses decreased on trails in all vegetation types; moss cover returned to predisturbance levels at a number of plots mostly due to increases of some moss species above control levels, while cover of other species remained low. Bare soil did not show recovery at the plots where it occurred. In moist sedge-shrub tundra, the physical environment and plant community continued to change away from pre disturbance conditions up to five years after disturbance. Permafrost degradation occurred on the most severely disturbed trails, leading to significant track depression and changes in species composition towards species better adapted to wet habitats. Active layer depths were significantly greater on trails than in adjacent control areas at all levels of disturbance in all vegetation types, except for riparian shrubland."

Adjoining refuge land totaling 3,573 acres is in agricultural production under the Service's cooperative farming program.  The fauna is diverse with many popular and important species present. Refuge wetlands are noted for large waterfowl wintering populations. Mallards are the most numerous species with wigeon, pintail, green-winged teal, and wood ducks being common. Waterfowl concentrations of up to 125,000 have been observed in recent years. Vast acreages of agricultural land in the Yazoo Basin attract high concentrations of mourning dove. This species has probably suffered less from changing agricultural practices than any other. Numerous species of shore birds and other migratory and resident birds utilize the refuge. Gray and fox squirrels, white-tailed deer, swamp and cottontail rabbit, raccoon, and bobwhite quail are the principal resident game species.

Seismic exploration occurred on the refuge during the winters of 1984 and 1985, and an exploratory well was drilled on adjacent Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation land during the winters of 1985 and 1986. Permanent study plots were established on vehicle trails and ice roads to document the initial disturbance. Eighteen intensive study plots and 14 photo-trend plots established on seismic trails in 1984 or 1985 were revisited in 1986. Three intensive and two photo-trend plots were established on ice roads and an ice airstrip at the wellsite in 1986 and revisited in 1987. Disturbance ratings remained the same on most plots in the second or third summers after disturbance. Trails were slightly less visible in each subsequent year due to weathering of dead plant litter and regrowth of vegetation. A statistically significant loss of plant cover (p~ 0.05) occurred at most disturbed plots, but few plots showed recovery. In riparian shrubland, cover values for horsetails showed recovery, but other species and life forms still had decreased cover compared to their controls. One highly disturbed Dryas terrace plot showed significant gains in cover of Dryas integrifolia, deciduous shrubs, and forbs, but still had the greatest cover loss of any study plot. Significant track depressions (p ~ 0.05) ranging from 5 to 15 em occurred at three of the four most disturbed plots in moist sedge-shrub tundra. An increase in track depression occurred at one plot between the first and third summers after disturbance. The three plots on ice roads had moderate and high levels of disturbance similar to that found on seismic trails through similar vegetation types. The two plots on the ice airstrip had been bladed to bare soil and had subsided 40 to 70 em in the second summer after disturbance. The data collected in this study will be used as a basis for measuring the long-term effects of seismic trails and ice roads on the arctic coastal plain."

Within this xeric landscape, legume density and species richness are maximized in small, topographic depressions known as bean dips and pea swales. Major indices of fertility are enhanced in these depressions, and productivity decreases withincreasing elevation. Legumes show patterns of sorting along these complex topographic gradients. In the Carolina Sandhills, twenty transects were established along slopes of depressions. Legume stem density, soil texture and chemistry, and relative elevation were measured at regular intervals. Although some legumes occurred most frequently on the upper slopes of depressions, most were confined to mesic bottoms. To clarify these findings, seeds and seedlings of select legume species were introduced to the gradient, and their performance was evaluated over one growing season. The number of germinated seeds surviving one growing season did not differ across the gradient for any single species, but differences between species were observed. Biomass also differed significantly between species, and was nearly twice as great in bottom plots for all but one species. These results provide a valuable supplement to the understanding of a unique community that deserves conservation priority. Restoration of degraded loamy soil communities could be guided by these findings."

The focus of the surveys    was not only to identify existing natural communities, but also to interpret landform and soils,    hydrology, past land use, and current natural and anthropogenic processes and disturbances at each    site.  After reviewing field data, aerial imagery, and other information, we identified and surveyed Humbug    Marsh and remnant forested communities on Grosse Ile and at Oakwoods Metropark. Field assessment    of natural communities included compiling a thorough list of dominant and representative vascular    plant species, describing site-specific structural attributes and ecological processes, analyzing soils and    apparent hydrological features (e.g., seasonally inundated depressions), noting current and historical    anthropogenic disturbances, evaluating potential threats, taking representative digital photos and GPS    points at significant locations, evaluating each site\u2019s natural community delineation and classification,    and noting significant management needs and restoration opportunities.  Based on field surveys and other data sources such as the original General Land Office (GLO) survey    notes, historical plat maps, historical literature, aerial photographs, studies on regional landscape    ecosystems and ecoregions, USDA NRCS digital soil maps, and the International Vegetation    Classification, we identified the highest quality field survey sites as examples of wet-mesic flatwoods, a    state imperiled forested natural community of low-relief lake plain characterized by mixed hardwood    dominance on relatively impermeable, seasonally wet to dry soils. The study area at Humbug Marsh was    interpreted primarily as old agricultural field in early stages of succession, with remnant areas of    historically cleared and grazed, mostly mesic oak \u2013 hickory forest. None of the study sites supported    significant concentrations of conservative vascular plant species or species typical of oak savanna or    prairie habitats.  If forest is the future desired condition of Humbug Marsh, land management practices such as the    planting of trees, selective harvest and canopy gap creation, reduction of the white-tailed deer    population, and control of invasive woody and herbaceous species (e.g., common buckthorn and garlic    mustard) should be considered in an experimental context. An alternative conservation management    option is to maintain and enhance early successional habitats at Humbug Marsh for declining wildlife    species and shade-intolerant plants. Although there is scant evidence of restorable savanna or prairie    communities at Humbug Marsh, Refuge staff could consider creating a demonstration planting of plant    species native to local savanna and prairie remnants to educate visitors about these critically imperiled    ecosystems. Given the sizable human population and presence of several colleges and universities in    metropolitan Detroit, Humbug Marsh is ideally situated for academic research, which should be    conducted in conjunction with land management activities to assess progress in a statistically rigorous    manner and in turn help refine conservation goals and land management techniques."

Several reasons for the decline have been suggested, including a decrease in carrying capacity from changes in habitat, and over fishing (in-river and in the ocean). This project was implemented to assess the quantity and quality of freshwater habitats used for spawning and rearing by coho salmon in streams near Perryville, and to use these data to conduct a limiting habitat analysis. The survey was repeated on Clear Creek, a neighboring drainage that supports viable runs of coho salmon. Work completed in 2002 includes: 1) completion of a habitat inventory on Kametolook River tributaries and on Clear Creek, 2) sampling of juvenile coho salmon in Clear Creek, 3) escapement monitoring in Clear Creek (weir) and streams near Perryville (walking surveys), and 4) application of a habitat limiting factor model to both systems. Over 43 km of stream in the Kametolook drainage and 12 km of stream in Clear Creek were surveyed in 2002. Habitat composition and quality were similar between systems. Juvenile coho salmon densities in Clear Creek in 2002 were similar to values reported in the literature. Based on length frequency data, it appears that only age 0+ coho salmon were present in Clear Creek (few if any age 1+ were observed). Scale samples will be collected concurrently with length data in 2003 to define the length at age relationships for juvenile coho salmon in Clear Creek. One thousand ninety-seven coho salmon were counted past the Clear Creek weir in 2002. Extrapolated counts of coho salmon were 337 (Three Star River), 342 (Artemie's Creek), and 37 (Cross Creek Slough) in streams near Perryville. The count of adult coho salmon in Clear Creek is a minimum estimate as the weir failed at several critical times during the season. Preliminary results from the habitat limiting factor analysis indicates that Clear Creek can support over 1,100 adult coho salmon, and the Kametolook system can support over 4,000 adult coho salmon. Estimates are considered minimum, as over 3,000 adult coho salmon have been observed in Clear Creek in past years."

The historic range of CMS likely was more extensive than the current restricted distribution, and logging of high-elevation red spruce forests during the early 1900s has been suggested as the most likely cause of CMS population declines. Remaining populations are geographically isolated and small in size and thus are subject to detrimental effects of genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and environmental stochasticity. Anthropogenic pressures on these populations include habitat modifications, especially those that remove the forest canopy, and habitat fragmentation. The effects of roads remain a concern for managers responsible for protecting CMS populations and their habitats. Areas in the CVNWR where CMS are known to exist (Bald Knob, Cabin Knob) are crisscrossed with old logging roads.

Implementers rehabilitate the road segments of RN2 and RN6 under the supervision of MCC and MCA (Activities). The byproduct of the activities performed is the rehabilitated roads: 120 km and 256 km of rehabilitated RN2 and RN6 road segments, respectively (Outputs). Note that unexpected delays in the implementation have occurred because of environment factors, such as extreme weather and civil unrest. These contingencies can prevent the timely rehabilitation of the roads. There may be other factors that affect the road rehabilitation project. For example, there could be cost overruns that reduce the length of roads that end up being rehabilitated (outputs), thus affecting fewer beneficiaries than planned (outcomes).  Some outcomes may be realized immediately upon completion of the project, while others may take longer to materialize. Once the road rehabilitation implementation is complete, it is expected that the time and cost required to travel to a certain destination via the rehabilitated roads will be reduced. Also, the targeted road segments will be improved in quality and are thus likely to be used more frequently. These outcomes are expected to be realized shortly after the completion of the roads (short-term outcomes). The completion of the road rehabilitation is also expected to unlock economic and social opportunities for households and individuals using the road (medium/long-term outcomes). For example, the project may improve access to markets to buy and sell products. It may also be easier and cheaper to find inputs needed for production activities for both formal enterprises and household informal economic activities. Due to the reduced time and cost of travel on the rehabilitated roads, households may enjoy easier access to basic facilities such as schools and health centers.

                "text": "Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study Introduction    Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.    Experimental Design    A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.    Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.    The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Methods    Vegetation and Soil Measurements    Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs (\uf03e 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide \u00d7 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm \u00d7 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.    Rainfall Simulations    Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105\u00b0C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).    Overland Flow Simulations    Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105\u00b0C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Resulting Data    The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.    Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center. This dataset is contribution number 134 of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project."

Escapement monitoring of coho salmon in the Ugashik Commercial Fishing District is from infrequent aerial surveys at the end of the season. The lack of in-season escapement information has lead to concerns of possible over harvest by the sport-fish user group. In 2000, the King Salmon Fish and Wildlife Field Office initiated a three-year counting tower project to estimate coho salmon escapement to address these concerns. Counting operations were conducted from mid-July to late-September each year using the standard Alaska Department of Fish and Game counting tower protocols. Escapement was estimated at 3,606 in 2001, 17,730 in 2002, and 28,212 in 2003. A total of 297 coho salmon were sampled for age, sex, and length data. Three age classes were identified; age class 2.1 was the most abundant each year, followed by age 1.1, and age 3.1. Mid-eye to fork lengths (mm) ranged from 465 to 687 in 2001, 452 to 663 in 2002, and 471 to 697 in 2003. Mean length at age varied between years and was largest for all age classes in 2003."

Ship-based time series, some now approaching over three decades long, are critical climate records that have dramatically improved our ability to characterize natural and anthropogenic drivers of ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake and biogeochemical processes. Advancements in autonomous ocean carbon observing technology over the last two decades have led to the expansion of fixed time series stations with the added capability of characterizing sub-seasonal variability. Here we present a data product of 40 autonomous moored surface ocean pCO2 and pH time series established between 2004 and 2013. These time series characterize a wide range of seawater pCO2 and pH conditions in different oceanic (17 sites) and coastal (13 sites) regimes including coral reefs (10 sites). With well-constrained daily to interannual variability and an estimate of decadal variability, these data suggest the length of time series necessary to detect an anthropogenic trend in seawater pCO2 and pH varies from 8 to 15 years at the open ocean sites, 16 to 41 years at the coastal sites, and 9 to 22 years at the coral reef sites. Only two open ocean pCO2 time series, WHOTS in the subtropical North Pacific and Stratus in the South Pacific gyre, are longer than the estimated time of emergence, and deseasoned monthly means show anthropogenic trends of 1.9+/-0.3 \u00c2\u00b5atm yr-1 and 1.6+/-0.3 \u00c2\u00b5atm yr-1, respectively. In the future, it is possible that updates to this product will allow for estimating anthropogenic trends at more sites; however, the product currently provides a valuable tool in an accessible format for evaluating climatology and natural variability of surface ocean carbonate chemistry in a variety of regions."

Chum salmon were the first fish to migrate past the weir beginning in June followed by Chinook, sockeye, pink, and coho salmon. Pink and coho salmon were still migrating past the weir when it was removed each fall. The sex composition of chum, Chinook, coho, and pink salmon was dominated by males. Predominate age classes for chum (age 0.3 and 0.4), Chinook (age 1.3), and coho (age 2.1) salmon were similar to other populations in Bristol Bay. Chinook and coho salmon lengths varied considerably between years, whereas chum salmon lengths did not show much annual variation."

Sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were the most abundant species counted through the weir (N = 14,788) followed by coho salmon O. kisutch (N = 5,003) and Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma (N = 890). Most sockeye salmon passed the weir at night during the high tide cycle. The weir was removed prior to the peak coho salmon run in 2006 because of budget constraints; therefore, our estimate is a minimum number. Sockeye salmon sampled at the weir were predominantly male (53%) and age 1.3 fish comprised 67% of the run. Female sockeye salmon sampled at the weir ranged in length from 504 to 581 mm and males ranged from 526 to 626 mm. Age, sex, and length data were not collected from coho salmon in 2006 because we were unable to sample the entire run. In 2006 we compared counts from motion-triggered video files to counts made by reviewing continuously recorded video files; counts were nearly identical. Motion detection functioned well except for times of high fish passage (> 300 fish/h) when small breaks in recording made it difficult to accurately count fish; continuously recorded video files were used to enumerate escapement during times of high fish passage. From 2001 to 2006, sockeye salmon escapement at the Mortensens Creek weir ranged from 4,268 to 21,703 (mean = 11,664) and coho salmon escapement ranged from 3,836 to 8,184 (mean = 5,478). The sex ratio of sockeye salmon varied over the years of the project, but no trends were apparent; age composition for sockeye salmon was similar over all years with age 1.3 predominant. Mean lengths of sockeye salmon were similar over all years of the project. Coho salmon sex composition also varied over project years without any apparent trends and age 2.1 fish were predominant each year. Mean lengths of coho salmon appeared to decline in 2004 and 2005, but we did not measure length in 2006 and did not determine if this trend continued. Sockeye and coho salmon populations in Mortensens Creek can continue to support harvest by all user groups at current levels, although the commercial fishery has the potential to overharvest this small sockeye salmon run."

Biological data were collected from sport-caught resident species and salmon. Sport angler effort was 1,340 angler-hours. Catch totaled 991 Arctic grayling, 878 arctic char and Dolly Varden combined, 177 coho salmon, 100 sockeye salmon, 24 lake trout, and 14 pinkeye salmon. Harvest totaled 44 coho salmon, and 23 arctic char and Dolly Varden combined. The typical angler at the Ugashik Narrows was guided, non-resident, and fished from shore. The length distributions of Arctic grayling, Arctic char, Dolly Varden, and coho salmon sampled from the sport fishery were examined. The modal age for Arctic grayling was 6 years old and for coho salmon the 2.1 age class. Biological data collected from Arctic grayling during this project were not sufficient for making valid comparisons with data from 1987 and 1988. Review of previous mark-recapture projects at the Ugashik Narrows indicates a need for a large-scale mark-recapture project over at least a 3-year project, in conjunction with a radiotelemetry study, before the current population status of Arctic grayling is properly understood."

Electrolytic capacitors are critical components in electronics systems in aeronautics and other domains. Degradation's in capacitor and MOSFET components are often the cause of failures in DC-DC converters. For example, prevalent fault effects, such as a ripple voltage surge at the power supply output, can damage interconnected critical subsystems leading to cascading fault propagation. Prognostics in general and in this case electronics components in particular is concerned with the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of components and systems. It performs a condition-based health assessment by estimating the current state of health. Furthermore, it leverages the knowledge of the device physics and degradation physics to predict remaining useful life as a function of current state of health and anticipated operational and environmental conditions. Physics-based models capture degradation phenomena in terms of component geometry and energy based principles that define the effect of stressors on the component behavior. This is in contrast to the traditional approach for deriving degradation models from empirical data. Implementing the degradation  modeling techniques    present a general methodology for estimating lifetimes due to specific failure mechanisms. The failure    rate models can be tuned to include parameters that relate to the present health of the device/system and the    expected conditions under which it will be operated.

In addition, within the T&D intervention group, we randomly assigned some communities to receive the financing scheme (FS) initiative. To assess impacts of the FS initiative, we compared outcomes of households in the randomly selected treatment communities with those of households in the control communities, adjusting for baseline characteristics. The key research questions we addressed were: (1) What are the impacts of being in communities selected to receive lines through the T&D activity? (2) What are the impacts of being in communities selected to receive low-cost connections through the FS initiative? (3) What are the impacts of being connected to the national grid? (4) Do the impacts vary by gender, age, income, or urbanicity?   Both the T&D analysis and the FS analysis utilize data from a baseline survey (conducted in 2011) and from a follow-up survey (conducted in 2015). The follow-up data are provided in this package. Key findings from the final evaluation include the following:  \u00b7   The T&D activity led to a large number of new connections, but it was less than a third of the 35,000 connections assumed at the outset.    \u00b7   The FS initiative also increased connection rates, but even if all T&D communities received low-cost connections, the number of connections originally assumed would still have not been achieved.     \u00b7   The T&D activity, FS initiative, and connection to the grid increased consumption of grid electricity, ownership of electric tools, time spent watching television, and perceived household safety.    \u00b7   The T&D activity increased the percentage of households doing an income-generating activity (IGA) that used grid electricity.    \u00b7   The FS initiative reduced poverty as measured by per capita consumption under $1 or $2 per day.     \u00b7   Being connected increased children's hours of studying at night, but it increased TV watching much more; being connected also increased income and reduced poverty.

RAJADAS, AND CLYDE COELHO  Abstract. Fatigue damage and its prediction is one of the foremost concerns of structural integrity    research community. The current research in structural health monitoring (SHM) is to    provide continuous (or on demand) information about the state of a structure. The SHM system    can be based on either active or passive sensor measurements. Though the current research on    ultrasonic wave propagation based active sensing approach has the potential to estimate very small    damage, it has severe drawbacks in terms of low sensing radius and external power requirements.    To alleviate these disadvantages passive sensing based SHM techniques can be used. Currently,    few efforts have been made towards, time-series fatigue damage state estimation over the entire    fatigue life (stage-I, II & III). A majority of the available literature on passive sensing SHM techniques    demonstrates the clear trend in damage growth during the final failure regime (stage-III    regime) or during when the damage is comparatively large enough. The present paper proposes a    passive sensing technique that demonstrates a clear trend in damage growth almost over the entire    stage-II and III damage growth regime. A strain gauge measurement based passive SHM frameworks    that can estimate the time-series fatigue damage state under random loading is proposed.    For this purpose, a Bayesian Gaussian process nonlinear dynamic model is developed to map the    reference condition dynamic strain at a given instant of time. The predicted strains are compared    with the actual sensor measurements to estimate the corresponding error signals. The error signals    estimated at two different locations are correlated to estimate the corresponding fatigue damage    state. The approach is demonstrated for an Al-2434 complex cruciform structure applied with    biaxial random loading."

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

We surveyed approximately 1,250 ha of bottomland hardwood forest on Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge for cavity trees and documented use by Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) as diurnal roosts. We found 622 cavity trees in our study area, of which, 562 could be examined for bat use and 49 were used by C. rafinesquii as roosts. Measurements were recorded at each tree including diameter at breast height (DBH), length and width of cavity opening, and the height of the internal chamber. Cavity trees were examined seasonally for use by bats. We compared known use trees to non-use trees at the time of the study for analysis. Analyses revealed that these bats most often used cavities of large diameter trees (>70 cm DBH) which ranged in size from 40-210 cm DBH. Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bats did not choose trees randomly based on species or size class according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov analyses. Tree species most commonly used were baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), and American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). These tree species were used in a greater percentage than what was available in the study area. Larger trees were typically used for colony (>5 bats) roosts with mean DBH at >100cm. Large diameter trees are rare in the southeast due to agricultural and urban developments. Bottomland hardwood forest management within the range of C. rafinesquii should include retaining all cavity trees for potential or future roost sites."

A distributed architecture though, is not effective unless there is an algorithmic framework to take advantage of its unique abilities. The health management paradigm envisaged here incorporates a heterogeneous set of system components monitored by a varied suite of sensors and a particle filtering (PF) framework that has the power and the flexibility to adapt to the different diagnostic and prognostic needs. Both the diagnostic and prognostic tasks are formulated as a particle filtering problem in order to explicitly represent and manage uncertainties; however, typically the complexity of the prognostic routine is higher than the computational power of one computational element (CE). Individual CEs run diagnostic routines until the system variable being monitored crosses beyond a nominal threshold, upon which it coordinates with other networked CEs to run the prognostic routine in a distributed fashion. Implementation results from a network of distributed embedded devices monitoring a prototypical aircraft electrical power system are presented, where the CEs are Sun Microsystems Small Programmable Object Technology (SPOT) devices."

A vehicle capable of evaluating its own health state and making (or assisting the crew in making) decisions with respect to its system health evolution over time will be able to go further and accomplish more mission objectives than a vehicle fully dependent on human control. This paper describes the development of a hardware testbed for integration and testing of prognostics-enabled decision making technologies. Although the testbed is based on a planetary rover platform (K11), the algorithms being developed on it are expected to be applicable to a variety of aerospace vehicle types, from unmanned aerial vehicles and deep space probes to manned aircraft and spacecraft. A variety of injectable fault modes is being investigated for electrical, mechanical, and power subsystems of the testbed. A software simulator of the K11 has been developed, for both nominal and off-nominal operating modes, which allows prototyping and validation of algorithms prior to their deployment on hardware. The simulator can also aid in the decision-making process. The testbed is designed to have interfaces that allow reasoning software to be integrated and tested quickly, making it possible to evaluate and compare algorithms of various types and from different sources. Currently, algorithms developed (or being developed) at NASA Ames - a diagnostic system, a prognostic system, a decision-making module, a planner, and an executive - are being used to complete the software architecture and validate design of the testbed."

Prognosis is here strictly defined as \u201cpredicting the time at which a component will no longer perform its intended function\u201d. Loss of function is often times the time at which a component fails. The predicted time to that point becomes then the remaining useful life (RUL). For prognostics to be effective, it must be performed well before deviations from normal performance propagate to a critical effect. This enables a failure preclusion or prevention function to repair or replace the offending components, or if the components cannot be repaired, to retire the system (or vehicle) before the critical failure occurs. Therefore, prognosis has the promise to provide critical information to system operators that will enable safer operation and more cost-efficient use. To that end, Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, and industry have been investigating this technology for use in their vehicle health management solutions. Dedicated prognostic algorithms (in conjunction with failure detection and fault isolation algorithms) must be developed that are capable of operating in an autonomous and real-time vehicle health management system software architecture that is possibly distributed in nature. This envisioned prognostic and health management system will be realized in a vehicle-level reasoner that must have visibility and insight into the results of local diagnostic and prognostic technologies implemented at the LRU and subsystem levels. Accomplishing this effectively requires an integrated suite of prognostic technologies that compute failure effect propagation through diverse subsystems and that can capture interactions that occur in these subsystems. In this chapter a generic set of selected prognostic algorithm approaches is presented and an overview of the required vehicle-level reasoning architecture needed to integrate the prognostic information across systems is provided."

Given the communication delay between Earth and the rover, and the possible occurrence of faults, an autonomous decision making system is essential to ensure that the rover maximizes the scientific operations performed without damaging itself further or stalling. This paper presents a modular software architecture for autonomous decision making for rover operations that uses diagnostic and prognostic information to influence mission planning and decision making to maximize the completion of mission objectives. The decision making system consists of separate modules that perform the functions of control, diagnosis, prognosis, and decision making.We demonstrate our implementation of this architecture on a simulated rover testbed."

Prognosis is a critical element of a HM system and has the promise to realize major benefits for cost avoidance and safety improvement for fielded systems. It also presents a number of challenges to the HM system designer, primarily due to the need to properly model damage progression and to deal with large-grain uncertainty. Long-term prediction of a fault\u2019s evolution to the point thatmay result in a failure requires means to represent and manage the inherent uncertainty. Moreover, accurate and precise prognosis demands good models of the fault growth and statistically sufficient samples of failure data to assist in training, validating, and fine tuning prognostic algorithms. Prognosis performance metrics, robust algorithms, and test platforms that may provide needed data have been the target of HM researchers in the recent past. Many accomplishments have been reported but major challenges still remain to be addressed.    To address the issue of inherent uncertainties that are the aggregate of many unknowns and can result in considerable prediction variability, the concept of adaptive prognosis was introduced. In that case, available, albeit imperfect, information is used to update elements of the prognostic model. Only one of many approaches for accomplishing this was briefly introduced, namely, the particle filter. Other statistical update techniques include Bayesian updating, constrained optimization, and Kalman filtering.    The design process is not a trivial process by which features and models are chosen for integration such that the best possible prediction on RUL still is obtained. It takes substantial effort to design systems so that measured data can be fused and used in conjunction with physics-based models to estimate current and future damage states. This is exacerbated when multiple models are employed that may use different feature inputs. The prognosis system must also be capable of intelligently calibrating a priori initial conditions (e.g., humidity, strain, and temperature) and random variable characteristics in an automated yet lucid process."

Reef-building corals are the primary architectural organism and are sensitive to environmental degradation; therefore, they are a good indicator of overall health for nearshore park's marine ecosystems. Primary stressors to coral reefs include disease, bleaching, sedimentation, eutrophication, storms, and global climate change.

All of these birds were territorial on short-grass (lawn) habitat. Spring migration from AS began during the second week of April well ahead of departure from Oahu which occurred in late April. The average at-capture body mass in both the AS and Oahu sample groups was statistically identical. Two of the birds were detected during subsequent monitoring surveys in Alaska. An AS plover was found on 25 April near the village of Egegik on the Alaska Peninsula, and a plover from Oahu was located on 23 May near Bethel in western Alaska. The route of the AS plover to Alaska is unknown, but from the great circle perspective a mid-Pacific flight traversing the Hawaiian Archipelago seems probable. A large percentage of the birds in both groups returned in the fall (AS 83%, Oahu 80%) and reoccupied previous territories.

Failure prognostic algorithms aim to characterize the evolution of incipient fault conditions in complex dynamic processes, thus allowing to estimate of the remaining useful life (RUL) of subsystems and components. Several examples can be used here to illustrate the range of possible applications for these algorithms: electro-mechanical systems, continuous-time manufacturing processes, structural damage analysis, and even fault tolerant    software architectures. Most of them have in common the fact that they are highly complex, nonlinear, and affected by large-grain uncertainty.  We introduce in this chapter an integrated failure prognosis architecture that is applicable to a variety of aircraft systems and industrial processes. We are targeting a specific rotorcraft system as a prototypical testbed for proof-of-concept. The overall architecture consists of an on-board and an off-board module for eventual on-platformimplementation purposes."

This aggregated spatial distribution means local environmental changes such as water fluctuation, water quality, predation, disturbance, or food availability can rapidly affect a proportionately high percentage of the population. The North American Waterbird Conservation Plan (NAWCP) states that 80% of waterbirds are colonial nesting species and one-third of those are at risk of serious population loss (Kushlan et al. 2002). Theplan calls for a regional approach to monitoring and conservation and states that the conservation assessment of waterbird populations is dependent upon collecting more information on population size, trends, and the relative importance of specific sites.At the regional level, the population statuses of western colonial waterbirds are not well understood and the Intermountain West Waterbird Conservation Plan, the regional stepdown plan for the NAWCP, expresses the need for additional baseline information to better inform management and implement conservation (Ivey and Herziger 2006).

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

The program had no impact on girls\u2019 math scores, though there is suggestive evidence it may have had a positive impact of 0.09 standard deviations on girls\u2019 French test scores. No significant impacts were detected for boys\u2019 enrollment, attendance, or test scores. Finally, impacts were larger for younger children (ages 7-10), than for those between the ages of 10 and 12.  After four years (using data collected in 2013 during the NECS Wave 1 data collection), the Niger IMAGINE Long-Term Evaluation found that IMAGINE had a 8.3 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a  7.9 percentage point negative impact on absenteeism.  On average, children in treatment villages scored 0.13 standard deviations higher on the math assessment than children in control villages (significant at the 5 percent level). Test scores in French for children in treatment villages were higher than in control villages, but were not statistically significant. The evaluation found  large and significant impacts of the program on enrollment, attendance, and math scores for females,    compared to more modest and less significant impacts for males."

                "text": "El Salvador - Formal Technical Education With a budget of nearly $20 million, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was designed to strengthen technical and vocational educational institutions in the Northern Zone of El Salvador. By improving schools and offering scholarships, the sub-activity financed efforts to increase youths' access to high-quality technical education in the region, thus increasing their achievement levels, secondary (and post-secondary) school graduation rates, and prospects for gainful employment. By 2012, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was scheduled to invest $3.8 million in scholarships for students enrolled in secondary and post-secondary technical schools in the Northern Zone. According to preliminary budgets, the sub-activity would also provide $9 million to improve 20 technical secondary schools in the Northern Zone with infrastructure investments and additional teacher training programs. In addition, the sub-activity was scheduled to invest $7 million to strengthen ITCHA, an existing post-secondary institute in the Northern Zone.   In conducting the evaluation of the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity-which includes secondary and post-secondary school improvements and scholarships-Mathematica will address the following research questions regarding Sub-Activity investments from 2009 to 2012:   1.Program design/implementation. How were the secondary school strengthening and scholarship programs, and the ITCHA strengthening program designed and implemented? Did implementation meet original targets and expectations? Why or why not?  2.Description of participants. What are the characteristics (age, gender, initial household income, etc.) of scholarship recipients? What are the basic characteristics of secondary school and ITCHA students?   3.Impact/Results. What is the impact of FOMILENIO's strengthening secondary school program on students' education and labor market outcomes, including secondary school enrollment, grade completion, graduation, and further education, employment, and income? What is the impact of the offer of scholarships in some programs within strengthened schools on student educational and labor outcomes? Did ITCHA graduates obtain jobs and experience increased income following graduation? Did ITCHA students who graduated from secondary school MEGATEC programs have better academic and labor market outcomes than students who did not attend secondary school MEGATEC programs?  4.Impacts/Results by key target subgroups. Were impacts/results different for girls versus boys? What types of participants experienced positive impacts?  5.Explanation for impact findings and results. What was the ex-post statistical power, and can this explain the lack of impacts (in cases where no impacts are found)? What aspects of implementation could explain the impacts/results? If impacts/results were different for girls versus boys, why?  6.Sustainability. Are secondary school improvements and scholarships being maintained? Are ITCHA improvements being maintained? Are they likely to be maintained in the medium to long term?   To answer all research questions regarding the design, implementation, and sustainability of the strengthening efforts and scholarships (Topics 1, 2, 5, and 6), Matheatica will use a mixed-methods evaluation design that uses qualitative and quantitative methods (see Table III.1). With this approach, researchers will use qualitative methods-namely, qualitative interview data and programmatic reports-to help understand processes and activities, provide information on setting or context, and communicate the perspectives and experiences of key participants through direct quotes. In addition, Mathematica will use quantitative information on program outputs and costs, participant characteristics, and budget outlays to summarize the intervention, describe its participants, and analyze the sustainability of its original investments.   To answer research questions regarding impacts and results (3, 4, and 5), Mathematica will use a variety of designs. To determine the impact of secondary school scholarships, researchers designed and implemented a random assignment design, by which some eligible applicants were randomly selected to receive scholarships. To determine the impact of secondary school strengthening investments, Mathematica designed and implemented a matched comparison group approach using propensity score methods, by which students at the 20 strengthened schools are compared to students at 20 similar non-strengthened schools. Finally, to measure key results of the ITCHA intervention-including graduation and employment rates-researchers used a mixed-methods approach that featured a follow-up survey of ITCHA students.   All impact and results analyses rely on in-person surveys, including panel surveys of scholarship applicants, cross-sectional baseline and follow-up surveys of secondary school students, and a follow-up survey of ITCHA students."

To evaluate the possible effects of Activity 1, the outcomes study will measure the training and labor market outcomes of trainees in PICG-supported courses approximately one year after they graduate and, to the extent possible, compare those outcomes with those of a relevant sample of trainees who attended non-supported courses. The qualitative study will explore implementation of all the project activities, the potential mechanisms driving the results observed in the Activity 1 outcomes study, and the likelihood of sustainability across all ISWD initiatives after the compact ends."

Of what data that is available, it shows a lack of data points, thus resulting in the inability to calculate survival estimates based on age or sex. Without this adequate sampling pool and analysis of data, management decisions cannot be accurately made with any type of reasonable certainty. Dave Olson with the Migratory Bird Program (USFWS) set forward to develop a banding project in an attempted to 1) collect enough data so a reliable survival rate can be calculated and 2) derivation and distribution of the harvest can be better understood for making management decisions (ref.1). The project design called for a 5 year banding project resulting in a minimum banding number of 5,700 Cinnamon teal within the first 4 years. Colorado was selected as one of 5 states to participate in this project. It was determined that the focus of banding activity in Colorado would be narrowed to the San Luis Valley (SLV). Potential banding sites were identified as Monte Vista NWR (MV), Alamosa NWR, Blanca Wetlands (BLM), and Russell Lakes SWA (CPW). Cooperative efforts were made with the land managers with each of these properties and banding efforts started in the summer of 2012. After the 2014 banding season, there has been 2,190 Cinnamon teal banded in the SLV, with 4,213 Cinnamon teal being banded throughout the 5 state banding project sites.  2015 is the fourth year of the five year banding project. Banding efforts occurred on the Monte Vista NWR (MV) and the Blanca Wetlands (BLM); however this report will only address banding operations on MV. In addition to banding this year, there was a request by Todd Felix from the USDA-APHIS \u2013 Wildlife Services to conduct testing for Avian Influenza Virus (AIV). Testing consisted of oral and cloaca swabbing and blood sampling. Another addition to this season was a graduate student project looking at the life cycle and strategies of CITE. Casey Setash was the graduate student conducting this project. During the banding season she assisted the banding crews with banding, and performed nasal disc tagging to several female CITE. This was done in an effort to assist in the following years surveys of CITE in regards to habitat use and philopatry (ref.2)."

The Glassy-winged sharpshooter, GWSS, (Homalodisca vitripennis) [Hemiptera: Cicadellidae], occurs naturally within the southern United States. Once restricted to the southeastern states, it was accidentally spread across the south into California. The GWSS is a voracious feeder, and can fly long distances, preferring to feed upon cultivated crops, ie. Grapevine, fruit trees, and in the nymphal stages many weeds and grasses.    The GWSS is a serious threat to the viticulture industry as the primary vector of the plant-infecting bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa, Xf. The GWSS feeds on a diverse number of plants, during which the bacteria can infect many tree fruit, nut, vine, and woody ornamental crops.    Glassy-winged Sharpshooter adults are \u00bd inch (13mm) long being fairly large for the Sharpshooter leafhopper family of insects. Sharpshooters use an ovipositor to lay eggs inside of the underside of leaves. The Sharpshooter will lay its eggs on almost any plant including cactus. The egg masses are usually composed of 10-20 eggs, but can lay more or as few as 1. Most of the egg masses have a waxy coating of brocosomes around the eggs for protection. The nymphs (5 instars) do not have wings, but develop wing pads in the 5th instar and are generally smaller than the adults, ranging in size from .07 inches (2 mm) to nearly \u00bd inch (13mm) long. The nymphs have very distinct red eyes. The Sharpshooter can consume about 300 times its own weight in fluids from the xylem vessels of the plants upon which it feeds, thus producing copious amounts of excreta fluid.    This dataset presents the Homalodisca vitripennis genome v1.0.

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded.

In the fall and winter 1994, aerial counts of adult coho salmon were conducted on several streams located along the Pacific Coast of the Alaska Peninsula and Becharof National Wildlife refuges. In 1995 and 1996, efforts were focused to estimate escapement of coho salmon on Clear and Sandy creeks. Escapement estimates were also generated opportunistically for pink (O. gorbuscha), chum (O. keta), and sockeye salmon (O. nerka). We assessed the applicability of using carcass counts to index escapement by exploring the relationship between escapement estimates and cumulative carcass counts between years and between streams. Live fish counts were extrapolated to estimate escapement using the area-under-the-curve method. Observer efficiency and species-specific residence times were measured on Clear Creek in 1996, and resulting averages were used in escapement calculations for Sandy Creek in 1995 and 1996, and for Clear Creek in 1995. Aerial survey counts of adult coho salmon in late September 1994 were highest for Yantarni (1,815), Nakalilok (1,790), Sandy (1,070), and Clear (655) creeks of the 22 streams surveyed. Eleven streams were resurveyed from the air on 1 December 1994. Counts of coho salmon were lower in December than in September for all 11 streams resurveyed, despite excellent survey conditions. Cumulative carcass counts were not significantly (r2 = 0.44) related to escapement estimates as the difference between these values varied greatly between years and between streams. In areas with high densities of bears like the streams we studied on the Alaska Peninsula, methods that rely on carcass counts may not be reliable indices of escapement because of predation on dead and dying fish. Observer efficiency averaged 74% for 13 trials conducted on Clear Creek in 1996, and was dependent on lighting, wind, and turbidity. Residence times were estimated to be 13.8 d for coho, 8.7 d for pink, 7.9 d for chum, and 18.1 d for sockeye salmon. Escapement estimates on Clear Creek, calculated using the average residence times and counts corrected for observer efficiency, were relatively consistent between 1995 and 1996 for coho (4,068 and 3,118), sockeye (122 and 338), and pink salmon (4,239 and 5,041), but were higher in 1996 (3,851) than in 1995 (1,885) for chum salmon. Estimates of escapement on Sandy Creek were higher in 1995 than in 1996 for coho (4,057 and 2,205), pink (17,969 and 2,676), and chum salmon (1,867 and 780). We suggest that observer efficiency and residence times be assessed concurrently with foot surveys as both parameters may vary between surveys, among streams, and between years, thereby influencing escapement estimates generated using the area-under-the-curve method. The number of surveys necessary to estimate escapement may, however, be minimized by setting the survey interval equal to or slightly less than the expected residence time specific to that survey period, without a substantial loss of accuracy."

                "text": "Litter and duff bulk densities in the southern United States; Joint Fire Science Program Project #04-2-1-49 The organic layer (i.e., litter and duff) can represent the majority of the fuels in southeastern forest ecosystems. Measurements of organic layer mass (or loading) are critical for estimating fuel consumption in wildland fires and resulting fire effects, including smoke emissions and tree mortality. Managers generally only have time to measure the depth of the litter and duff layers. To convert depth measurements to mass, bulk density numbers are required for each layer. Previous field research to quantify organic layer bulk densities in the southeastern region of the United States has been generally confined to a small number of samples in very specific forest types.In this study, litter and duff depths and bulk densities were quantified from 2280 samples collected in 5 forest types (slash pine, loblolly pine, hardwoods, shortleaf pine, and mixed pine and hardwoods) across 7 states in the southeastern United States. Average site litter depths ranged from 0.88 to 2.19 inches, with an average depth of 1.44 inches for all forest types. Litter bulk densities ranged from 0.95 to 3.29 t/ac/in, with an average of 1.91 t/ac/in. Duff depths ranged from 0.32 to 2.41 inches; average duff depth was 0.91 inches. Duff bulk densities ranged from 3.12 to 11.02 t/ac/in; average bulk density was 6.10 t/ac/in. Evaluating the data by forest type, the average litter and duff depths and bulk densities for pine sites were 1.44 and 0.91 inches and 2.04 and 6.41 t/ac/in. Average litter and duff depths and bulk densities for hardwood sites were 1.42 and 0.88 inches and 1.38 and 4.84 t/ac/in.This study improved estimates of bulk density values for use in the Fuel Characteristic Classification System, consumption and fire effects software, including Consume 3.0 and the First Order Fire Effects, and the new DMM600 Duff Moisture Meter. They also provide improved estimates of carbon stores and of smoke produced during wildland fires in southern forests."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

                "text": "Normal behavior of snow geese on the Yukon-Alaska north slope and the effects of aircraft-induced disturbance on this behavior During September, large numbers of snow geese (up to 400,000) congregate on the North Slope of Yukon and Alaska where they accumulate energy reserves to fuel their fall migration. These geese are potentially susceptible to disturbance by aircraft overflights. This study was designed to document normal (i.e. undisturbed) behavior of snow geese during staging, and evaluate the effects of overflights by various types of aircraft upon this behavior. The ability of snow geese to accommodate to increased disturbance was assessed. In September 1973, observations of snow geese were made at five camps along the North Slope. The behavior of undisturbed geese was documented during 663 hours of observations on over 175 flocks. The behavior of geese during 73 natural disturbances and 163 non-experimental aircraft overflights was observed. Experimental overflights at two hour and half hour intervals using a small fixed wing aircraft (Cessna 185) and a small helicopter (Bell 206-B) were used to assess the reactions of snow geese to controlled disturbances. These experiments also provided data on the ability of snow geese to accommodate to an increased frequency of disturbance. Undisturbed snow geese spent 57% of daylight hours feeding. For the juveniles alone this figure was 65-70%. Flocks of snow geese were equally prone to flush in response to fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. They flushed at greater distances from helicopters, but flew for a longer time and exhibited longer overall interruption of normal behavior in response to fixed-wing aircraft. Snow geese accommodated to a varying extent to increased frequencies of overflights by small fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Non-experimental aircraft disturbances averaged 0.25 per daylight hour. These resulted in a potential decrease of 2.6% in time spent feeding. Experimental overflights at two hour intervals by fixed-wing aircraft produced more severe reactions. These caused an 8.5% decrease in feeding time, and could cause a reduction of 20.4% in the energy reserves that juvenile geese can acquire on the North Slope in preparation for migration. The corresponding figure for overflights by small helicopter is a possible reduction of 9.5%. These potential decreases are dependent upon the extent of  and the ability to increase overall feeding efforts."

                "text": "Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study Introduction    Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.    Experimental Design    A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.    Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.    The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Methods    Vegetation and Soil Measurements    Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs (\uf03e 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide \u00d7 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm \u00d7 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.    Rainfall Simulations    Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105\u00b0C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).    Overland Flow Simulations    Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105\u00b0C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Resulting Data    The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.    Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center. This dataset is contribution number 134 of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project."

Research was conducted during winters 1988-89 and 1989-90 in greentree reservoirs (GTR) in east central Mississippi (Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge) and the alluvial valleyof western Mississippi (Delta National Forest). Density estimates for both duck species were generatedusing line-transect data and a computer program named TRANSECT II. Among GTRs and between years, wood duck and mallard densities ranged from 0.45-12.69 ducks/ha (0.18-5.14 ducks/ac) and 1.06-11.37 ducks/ha (0.43-4.60 ducks/ac), respectively. Coefficients of variation (CV) for densityestimates ranged from 15-61% and 27-56% for wood ducks and mallards, respectively. To minimize variation in density estimates, line transect sampling for wintering wood ducks and mallardsshould be conducted in forested wetlands that can be waded by observers, and when wintering duck numbers are at peak levels. Future surveys should attempt to record at least 30 observations of each duck species to estimate their density with cvs ~ 30%. Although line-transect sampling was laborious (2 observers surveyed about 0.5 km/h [0.31 mi/h]), it was a functional and economical ($100/km2 [$259/mi2) technique for estimating densities of wintering ducks in flooded hardwood bottoms from ground surveys. However, the technique should be tested at other sites with large concentrations of wood ducks and/or mallards to validate its utility. Numbers of wood ducks and mallards flying toward GTRs at dusk and counts of both species in GTRs from a helicopter were positively correlated with estimates of duck density in the GTRs derived from ground transect surveys. However, numbers of both species observed from fixed-winged aircraft were not related to densities estimated from ground transect surveys. Although further testing and validation elsewhere are necessary because of small sample sizes in this study, flying duck counts at dusk and helicopter surveys seemed promising for estimating (or indexing) waterfowl abundance in forested wetlands during winter. Cost of helicoptersurveys was about $112/km2 ($291/mi2). Helicopter surveys seemed best suited for surveys of large and/or widely dispersed forested wetlands, whereas flying duck counts appeared most applicable for economically indexing trends in waterfowl abundance in forested wetlands. Availability of natural cavities for nesting wood ducks was studied on 5 areas in 3 southeastern states(Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana) during 1988-90. Palustrine forested wetlands dominated by bald cypress and tupelo gum were randomly sampled, using 0.5-ha plots (lOOm x 50m) plots, to estimate density of cavities potentially suitable for nesting wood ducks. Suitable cavity density in live, mature (~ 28 em [~ 11 in] dbh, average age = 118 yrs) bald cypress-tupelo gum averaged 0.083 cavities/ha (0.034 cavities/ac) and ranged from zero to 0.286 cavities/ha (0.116 cavities/ac). Cavities in tree boles or limbs with open tops were deemed unsuitable because of their tendency to retain water even in dry periods. The average cavity density in this study was lower than any density reported earlier in the scientific literature. Apparent low cavity densities in bald cypress-tupelo gum stands further suggested the need for artificial nesting boxes if wood duck production is a management goal. Nest success of wood ducks in bald cypress-tupelo gum stands was based on a total of 4 active nests found duringfield work. Only 1 nest was successful."

The model has been used to evaluate a wide variety of technologies and management strategies, and these analyses have been reported in the scientific and farm-trade literature. Systems research in dairy and beef production remains as the primary purpose of this tool, but the model also provides an effective teaching aid. With the model, students gain a better appreciation for the complexity of livestock forage systems. The learn how small changes affect many parts of the system, causing unanticipated results. They may also use the model to develop a more optimum food production system. When used in extension type teaching, producers can learn more about their farms and obtain information useful in strategic planning. By testing and comparing different options with the model, those offering the greatest economic benefit with acceptable environmental impact can be found.    Input information is supplied to the program through three parameter files. The farm parameter file contains data describing the farm such as crop areas, soil type, equipment and structures used, numbers of animals at various ages, harvest, tillage, and manure handling strategies, and prices for various farm inputs and outputs. The machinery file includes parameters for each machine available for use on a simulated farm.    Simulation output is available in four files, which contain summary tables, report tables, optional tables, and parameter tables. The summary tables provide average performance, environmental impact, costs, and returns for the years simulated. These values consist of crop yields, feeds produced, feeds bought and sold, manure produced, nutrient losses to the environment, production costs, income from products sold, and the net return or profitability of the farm. Values are provided for the average and standard deviation of each over all simulated years. The report tables provide extensive output information including all the data given in the summary tables. In these tables, values are given for each simulated year of weather as well as the mean and variance over all simulated years. Optional tables are available for a closer inspection of how the components of the full simulation are functioning. These tables include very detailed data, often on a daily basis. Parameter tables summarize the input parameters specified for a given simulation. These tables provide a convenient method of documenting the parameter settings used for a simulation."

The average number of black-legged kittiwake adults and nests on all plots were low, breeding chronology was later than past years and breeding performance parameters were very poor. This year's failure can be attributed primarily to failure to lay and secondarily to high egg loss. The average number of common murre adults on all plots were low, breeding chronology was later than past years and breeding performance parameters were poor. This year's poor breeding performance parameters can be attributed primarily to high egg loss and secondarily to moderate chick loss. Pelagic cormorant adult and nest numbers were about average, breeding chronology was later than past years and productivity was low but within the range reported for previous years. Predation and disturbances to seabirds were recorded. Common ravens accounted for most of the predation on cliff-nesting seabirds. Throughout the season boats traveled much closer than the recommended limits of 3 miles from shore. It is highly probable that all vessels traveling within 0.5 miles of the shore disturbed seabirds. Aircraft were observed flying below the recommended altitude of 2, 000 feet above ground level ( AGL ). Aircraft flying lower than 1, 000 feet typically flushed seabirds from cliffs while multiple-engine aircraft flying at 5,000 feet or above did not disturb seabirds. Beached bird surveys were performed documenting relatively few washed-up seabird carcasses along Maggy Beach, North Spit, and in Nanvak Bay. There has been a wide range in numbers of beached birds since 1989 and this can be attributed to the incidental methodology for documenting this parameter."

In 1988, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated detailed investigations of the extent of irrigation induced contaminants affecting fish, wildlife, and human health in and near Stillwater Wildlife Management Area, in the Carson River drainage basin in west central Nevada. Study objectives included the determination of the extent of trace element contamination and wetland deterioration, the definition of contaminant pathways, and the identification of contaminant source areas, in preparation for remediation.  Approximately 10 percent of historic wetlands at the terminus of the Carson River remain and the quality of water now reaching the wetland has been degraded. Concentrations of dissolved solids in marsh inflow water is approximately 5 times greater than is believed to have existed prior to agricultural diversion and water consumption beginning in the late 1800's. Degraded water quality has contributed to decreases in the abundance and diversity of wetland vegetation, fish, and wetland dependent wildlife.  Acute toxicity was shown in water of some agricultural drains and wetlands through bioassays using fish and invertebrates. Toxicity was attributed to a combination of arsenic, boron, lithium, and molybdenum. Rapidly fluctuating levels of dissolved solid and ionic composition may also be contributing to additional stress to aquatic organisms.  Evidence suggests that mercury and selenium are bioaccumulated and biomagnified. Selenium, mobilized by agricultural activities, is transported to wetlands within organic material through the agricultural drains, particularly during peak discharge events. The selenium hazard to migratory birds was greatest in wetlands receiving plant and invertebrate drift directly from drains. However, evidence linking migratory birds mortality in the study area to selenosis was not found, and selenium concentrations in wetland biota were not cumulative in response to decades of irrigation drainage. High levels of mercury, introduced in the late 1800's by mining activities, were found at sites associated with the historic floodways of the Carson River. Mercury continues to bioaccumulate in organisms from these previously contaminated areas.  Although waterfowl production was reduced in the study area, contaminants did not appear to effect hatching success. Concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements found in waterfowl eggs were below those reported to adversely affect development or hatching. Likewise, no evidence of teratogenesis in migratory bird embryos or juveniles was found. Poor waterfowl production was attributed to extended drought conditions, absence of water, sparse nesting vegetation, and predation.  Mercury and selenium levels in tissues of adult waterfowl harvested in the study area were sufficient to warrant human health concerns. Levels varied among waterfowl species with highest levels found in shoveler ducks, where mercury levels were great enough to warrant a Nevada State Health Advisory for the consumption of shovelers taken at Carson Lake. Evidence was found that waterfowl are accumulating mercury and selenium within the wetlands."

Reported here are the results of the wildlife bioindicator portion of the study. The goals of the study were to determine the nature and extent of environmental contaminant burdens in the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) population of the upper Niagara River area, and to evaluate the potential for negative impacts to that population. Reproductive parameters and contaminant burdens of the upper Niagara River area Common Tern populations are compared to the Atlantic coast and lower Great Lakes populations. Between 1986 and 1988, 62 Common Tern eggs, nine Herring Gull eggs and 17 forage fish samples from the upper Niagara River area were collected and analyzed for organic and elemental residues. The results indicate that organochlorine, heavy metal, and polyaromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon contamination in upper Niagara River Common Terns is low and does not appear to impair reproduction. A comparison of the P,P'-DDE:PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) ratios for Common Tern and Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) eggs showed them to be nearly the same. Those for Common Tern eggs and forage fish were similar and showed a parallel decline between 1986 and 1988. These comparisons suggest that the concentration of contaminants found in Common Tern eggs reflected local levels rather than contaminant levels on their wintering grounds. Hence, Common Terns were good indicators of upper Niagara River contaminants. Despite the low levels of contaminants found in the Common Tern eggs and forage fish sampled, the terns experienced poor hatching and fledging success. Predation and poor habitat quality may be the primary factors affecting the breeding success of terns in the upper Niagara River population. However, the high incidence of egg and chick predation and the indirect effects of predation at the tern colonies studied may have masked any observable linkage between poor reproductive performance of Common Terns with local contaminant burdens. Other factors, such as behavioral abnormalities, embryotoxicity, and embryonic mortality that are known to be pollution-induced, should not be ruled out as having contributed to the poor reproductive success of the Common Terns. In particular, a study should be initiated to investigate parental nest attentiveness, prehatching mortality, and eggshell structure of the Common Terns nesting in the upper Niagara River area to further address the concern over the decline in the population."

Specifically, SI has been tasked to \u201cassess the program design and implementation to develop the most rigorous evaluation design feasible, whether it is a performance or impact evaluation, and identify the most appropriate evaluation methodology feasible given the context.\u201d     Efforts to identify a research design that would allow for a rigorously defined counterfactual were unsuccessful, and as a result this design document outlines plans for a rigorous performance evaluation that will aim to measure key outcome indicators early on in the Compact, midway through, and at the end of the Compact, as well as track changes over time. This evaluation is designed to address the core questions of the evaluation (Table 1) Since the proposed design is a performance evaluation, it is important to note that it may not be possible to state with confidence how the power sector in Malawi has changed (or not changed) as a result of the Compact, as it will not be possible to control for other potential causes of change. In some cases, however, it may be feasible to identify and potentially rule out alternative explanations.    The inability to define a counterfactual requires a reformulation of some of the initial evaluation questions originally proposed by MCC, including some core questions included in the SI-MCC contract. In addition, the Evaluation Assessment Report revealed that both SI and MCC had substantial concerns with regard to the original research questions proposed in Social Impact's contract. This is natural given the way that interventions change over time, and that the proposed questions should be feasible to answer based on the data that can be collected as part of the evaluation. Based on SI's comprehensive desk review, information gathered during the scoping trip, and frequent communication with MCC and MCA-M, the SI evaluation team has developed research questions and research approaches for the PSRP and the IDP project components, as proposed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The original questions and the suggested modifications for each question are presented in the Appendix.   Research Questions    Through a rigorous performance evaluation, the evaluation design aims to answer the following core evaluation questions and several complementary research questions:         What declines in poverty, increases in economic growth, reductions in the electricity related cost of doing business, increases in access to electricity, and increases in value added production are observed over the life of the Compact?         What were the results of the interventions - intended and unintended, positive or negative?         Are there differences in outcomes of interest by gender, age and income? Sex and income disaggregated information for businesses and households will be pursued to the extent possible.         What are the lessons learned and are they applicable to other similar projects?         What is the likelihood that the results of the Project will be sustained over time?         At the household level, the evaluations shall focus on the following program/project/activities impacts on household and individuals: income; expenditures, consumption and access to energy; individual time devoted to leisure and productive activities.          At the enterprise level, the evaluation shall focus on the potential impact of the program/project/activities on: business profitability and productivity; value added production and investment; employment and wage changes; energy consumption and sources of energy used; business losses.          At the regulatory, institutional and policy level, the evaluation shall explore the potential impacts of the program/project/activities on: utility operating costs and losses; financial sustainability; private investment, particularly in generation; expansion of electricity access for customers, particularly the poor.    To answer these questions, the PSRP evaluation design will leverage diverse research methodologies with different timelines for data collection. The evaluation design can be broken into:   \u00b7 PSRP evaluation: The PSRP design incorporates five data collection activities, including: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E Plan and Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses with relevant units, such as billing and procurement, (3) a series of largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4) a proposed survey of Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) employees, and (5) the PSRP process evaluation, focused on implementation and achievement of implementation milestones and outputs will be folded into the PSRP data collection activities.     \u00b7 Enterprise survey: A panel survey of businesses will be used to evaluate both the PSRP and the IDP.   PSRP    Social Impact proposes five data collection activities for the PSRP evaluation: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E Plan and MERA key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses with relevant units, (3) largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4) a survey of current ESCOM employees, and (5) process evaluation. These activities will occur in three phases: at baseline (to be conducted as soon as possible), at midline, and at the end of the Compact. The evaluation will seek to identify changes over time and then consider the extent to which any observed improvements can be attributed to Compact activities."

The IBI provids a consistent theoretical framework for analyzing fish assemblage data. The IBI is an aggregation of 12 biological metrics that are based on the fish assemblage's taxonomic and trophic composition and the abundance and condition of fish. Such multiple-parameter indices are necessary for making objective evaluations of complex systems. The IBI was designed to evaluate the quality of small Midwestern warmwater streams but has been modified for use in many regions (e.g., eastern and western United States, Canada, France) and in different ecosystems (e.g., rivers, impoundments, lakes, and estuaries. The index of biotic integrity is an environmental assessment of a stream based on ecological metrics applied to the resident fish community (Karr, 1981). Twelve metrics address species richness and composition, trophic structure, fish abundance, and fish condition (Table 1). Each metric reflects the condition of one aspect of the fish community and is scored against expectations under reference conditions. Potential scores are 1-poor, 3-intermediate, or 5-the best to be expected. Scores for the 12 metrics are summed to produce the IBI for the site. The IBI is then classified using the system developed by Karr et al. (1986) rating the site from \u201cVery poor\u201d to \u201cExcellent\u201d. Additional information on the strategies underlying the methodology and individual metrics is presented by Plafkin et. al. (1989).The metrics attempt to quantify a park biologist's best professional judgment of the quality of the fish assemblage. The IBI utilizes professional judgment, but in a prescribed manner, and it includes quantitative standards for discriminating the condition of the fish assemblage. Best professional judgmentis involved in choosing both the most appropriate population or assemblage element that is representative of each metric and in setting the scoring criteria. This process can be easily and clearly modified, as opposed to judgments that occur after results are calculated. Each metric is scored against criteria based on expectations developed from appropriate regional reference sites. Metric values approximating, deviating slightly from, or deviating greatly from values occurring at the reference sites are scored as 5, 3, or 1, respectively. The scores of the 12 metrics are added for each station to give an IBI ranging from a maximum of 60 (excellent) to a minimum of 12 (very poor). Additional classifications can be derived from information in State and regional fish texts, by objectively assessing a large statewide database, or by contacting authors/originators of regional IBI programs or pilot studies. Use of the IBI by water resource agencies may result in further modifications. Many modifications have occurred without changing the IBI's basic theoretical foundations.The IBI serves as an integrated analysis because individual metrics may differ in their relative sensitivity to various levels of biological condition. A description and brief rationale for each of the 12 IBI metrics is outlined below. The original metrics described by Karr (1981) for Illinois streams are followed by substitutes used in or proposed for different geographic regions and stream sizes. Because of zoogeographic differences, different families or species are evaluated in different regions, with regional substitutes occupying the same general habitat or niche. The source for each substitute is footnoted below. Species Richness and Composition Metrics: These metrics assess the species richness component of diversity and the health of resident taxonomic groupings and habitat guilds of fishes. Two of the metrics assess assemblage composition in terms of tolerant or intolerant species.Species Richness and Composition Metrics: Metric 1.

These five phases differ slightly from the six main steps identified in the IGP grant manual; however, all of the activities reflected in the grant cycle implementation figure (p. 19 of the grants manual) are included in the five phases below. We chose to establish slightly different grant cycle implementation phases so the performance evaluation can address a critical element not reflected in the IGP manual's phases: \u201crevising the process.\u201d This phase is a critical component of the performance evaluation of the IGP facility.    AIR's performance evaluation of the IGP is structured around the five phases of IGP implementation mentioned above. AIR will use the following overarching questions as a framework to the evaluation question design:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   Did the IGP adhere to its objectives:    1.  To increase and sustain the access of the poor to quality water and sanitation and improved drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    2.  To enhance the functioning of the water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems?    3.  To demonstrate an innovative approach or technology to improve water use, sanitation, and hygiene practices among the poor?    4.  To identify and provide assistance to innovative partnership arrangements, particularly through private sector engagement?    5.  To provide significant access by women and vulnerable groups to the IGP and its benefits?    6.  To expand opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generating activities related to water supply, sanitation, and drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    \u00b7   Did the grant selection process prioritize interventions based on its key objectives, and was process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects?    \u00b7   Is grant oversight sufficient?  Is it cost-effective?    \u00b7   How can the Innovation Grant Program better mobilize private-sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCC specifically or another organization best replicate this program?    Start-up: During start- up, we will investigate the effectiveness of the IGP solicitation process to potential grantees. Another key area of interest will be gathering the demographic information of the grantees. The evaluation of the IGP's start-up phase will be based on the questions below:    \u00b7   What is the implementation plan for the grants?    \u00b7   How is information about the program disseminated?     \u00b7   Have there been specific outreach and dissemination activities targeting potential grantees that are best qualified to provide high quality services to women's groups, poor communities, and new entrepreneurs?    \u00b7   Does the MCA provide assistance with grant development, funding guidelines, and budgeting?     \u00b7   Does MCA facilitate connections between (potential) applicants or between applicants and government agencies?    \u00b7   Do targeted communities and stakeholders understand the intention and structure of the grant program?     \u00b7   What is the proportion of grantees from each technical intervention area (i.e. solid waste removal)?     \u00b7   What are potential grantees' and their communities' expectations of the program?     \u00b7   How well informed are potential grantees of the application and selection process, and of the available resources and support to help them participate?    \u00b7   How many grantees apply and how many applications do grantees submit?    \u00b7   How many applications meet the basic qualifications for participation in the program?     \u00b7   Do the interventions supported by the IGP clearly benefit poor communities, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs?     \u00b7   To what extent do the number and nature of applications meet MCA expectations?     \u00b7   To what extent do the applications cover a broad range of services and service areas?    \u00b7   Are proposals received highly relevant to the proposal call area and well distributed across the different calls areas?     \u00b7   Do the problem statements and proposal calls address areas that key IGP stakeholders perceive to be high impact?    Selection: During selection, we will investigate the selection process of the IGP with particular focus on the scoring procedures of the grants. Additionally, AIR will also examine the ways in which selection decisions are communicated to the grantees. Selection questions include:    \u00b7   Does IGPM follow its rules for reviewing, rating, and ranking grant applications?     \u00b7   Are the reviewers adequately trained and supported?     \u00b7   Is the review process fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of potential grantees?    \u00b7   Are grantees notified of the grant decision in a timely and effective way?    \u00b7   Are grantees provided with feedback that enables them to improve their grant application and resubmit?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants understand and accept the outcome of the selection process?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants plan to resubmit revised applications?     \u00b7   Are rejected applicants requesting assistance with resubmission?     \u00b7   How many grants are awarded?     \u00b7   What is the average grant size?     \u00b7   What proportion of available funds is committed to accepted grants?     \u00b7   Is the grant selection process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects based on how the projects align with IGP investment criteria?     Implementing the award: During the implementation phase, we will investigate the process of implementing the award. AIR will closely examine the negotiations of grantees' contracts, the process in which funds are disbursed, and the ability of grantees to successfully meet their quarterly goals. Illustrative research questions include:    \u00b7   How did the negotiations of the contract impact the implementation of the award?     \u00b7   Are grantees adequately supported with necessary technical and managerial assistance?    \u00b7   Are funds transmitted to grantees in a timely and efficient way?     \u00b7   Are grantee spending and performance adequately and efficiently monitored?    \u00b7   Do grantees receive timely feedback on their performance?     \u00b7   How does MCA monitor its own performance in the operation of the grant program?    \u00b7   Is MCA meeting its own expectations for successful implementation of the grant program?     \u00b7   How well is the grant program integrated into other compact activities?    \u00b7   What proportion of awarded grant funds is spent on time and on target?     \u00b7   What proportion of grantees achieves their performance objectives at various points throughout the grant period?    \u00b7   Is MCA's oversight of the grants sufficient and cost effective in terms of spending and M&E targets? \u00b7   Does MCA-Zambia/IGPM verify that applicants have met quarterly milestones before awarding the conditional grant disbursements?     \u00b7   What percentages of applicants fail to receive disbursements on time due to failure to meet quarterly milestones?    Completing the award: During the completion phase of the award, we will investigate the sustainability and impact of the grantees' programs. In particular, how effective IGP efforts were in increasing access to clean water and sanitation to vulnerable communities. AIR will pay particular attention to grantees' ability to successfully sustain its programs efforts and the impacts of these programs on their catchment communities. As part of these efforts, AIR will examine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders regarding grantees' programs. However, it is important to note that a full assessment of IGP may not be possible due to the short timeframe.  Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   What proportion of grantees is still active in business at the end of the grant period?    \u00b7   What proportions of the grants demonstrate potentially viable, long-term, profit-generating business opportunities?     \u00b7   How do civil society organizations and policy makers perceive the changes the program has made to the overall infrastructure for water, sanitation, and drainage services in Lusaka?    \u00b7   How aware of the program are households, civil society organizations, policy makers, and other water and sanitation focused stakeholders?     \u00b7   Has the grantee spurred \u201ccopycat\u201d organizations?    \u00b7   Did the grantees feel that they received adequate time to thoroughly complete all of the interventions?    \u00b7    To what extent are the benefits of the program cited as reasons for larger systemic changes by policy makers and compact implementing entities?     \u00b7   What is policy makers and compact implementing entities' perception of the extent to which the program has created individual interventions and structures that are sustainable even after program funding ends?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new partnerships between organizations in water, sanitation, or solid waste value chain?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new private sector investment in the sector?    \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new/ refined models of pro-poor service delivery?     \u00b7   What is the perception of benefits to the poor and vulnerable populations?     Revising the process: During this phase, AIR will investigate IGP's ability to successfully meet its objectives. As part of this process, AIR will examine the ways in that the IGP process could be further improved. Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   How can the IGP better mobilize private sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCA specifically or another organization best replicate this program?"

The backwater system is the Keithsburg Division management unit of the Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge located in the floodplain of Navigation Pool 18. The surface water and groundwater sources for this backwater are agricultural drainage water and streams impacted by rural non-point source pollution. The environmental quality parameters that were studied included water quality, sediment quality and toxicity testing, organism health and ecological diversity. The chemistry data indicated nutrient rich surface water, groundwater and aquatic sediment resources in the refuge unit. The concentrations of toxic contaminants detected in the water and aquatic sediment resources were below lethal benchmark values for aquatic life. The concentrations of herbicide chemicals detected in surface water and aquatic sediments were above levels that may stress aquatic plants. Poor aquatic macroinvertebrate and plant diversity was observed in many areas around the refuge unit. We suggest that the loading of nutrients in these areas was sufficient to cause changes to the structure and composition of refuge plant communities and related shifts in invertebrate populations. The altered ecological communities in the polluted areas function to treat nitrogen inputs, providing less diverse wildlife habitats. Several lake and watershed management strategies are discussed to help increase habitat diversity and benefits to migratory birds. It is important to note that an increment of improvement in the watershed will not necessarily result in an increment of improvement in habitat quality in the backwater system. It is possible that little or no ecological change may occur or be observed at Keithsburg Division until a critical level is reached in the watershed resulting in a noticeable shift in refuge habitat quality."

This document describes sample methods and results. It includes a discussion of the water quality sampling results and compares the results to the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for Protection of Aquatic Life and to USEPA water quality criteria. Malheur NWR has identified poor aquatic health as the biggest issue the refuge is facing and has identified common carp as the largest contributor to degrading aquatic habitat. The Double O unit is a management unit of the refuge that has a low carp population compared to other areas of the refuge and it may be feasible to exclude or control carp on the unit. However, Barnyard Spring on the Double O unit had almost no response in submergent vegetation or aquatic invertebrate production following carp removal. In contrast, Sodhouse Spring, near the refuge headquarters, responded almost immediately with luxuriant growth of submergent vegetation and abundant aquatic invertebrates and bird use has been very high since carp removal. The objective of this investigation was to determine if one or more trace elements are present at concentrations high enough to limit productivity in some springs on the Double O unit. Water quality samples were collected at a number of sites on the Double O and analyzed for 22 constituents, including arsenic, which is common in springs and groundwater in the Great Basin. The results showed that concentrations of arsenic were highest in the Barnyard Springs area and were above the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines but below the USEPA Water Quality Criteria. Aluminum and boron concentrations were also high in these springs. The water quality sampling results provide evidence that arsenic could be limiting productivity in this area, although the evidence is not conclusive. The study indicates that refuge springs with higher arsenic levels (geothermal sources) should receive lower priority to conduct carp control for habitat restoration given the expense of rotenone treatments."

                "text": "Assessment of mercury in edible fish fillets at Seney National Wildlife Refuge This report is a follow-up to work conducted by the East Lansing Field Office (ELFO) at Seney National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in 1987-88 to assess the presence and degree of contamination in soils and biota due to historic on-site management activities (Best et aJ. 1995). While the onsite activities were found not to have impacted biota, fish collected from several ponds on the refuge were found to have elevated levels of mercury (Hg) in whole fish and skinless fillets. Levels of Hg in the larger northern pike (Esox lucius) exceeded State and Federal criteria for human consumption and interstate trade, respectively (>0.5 and >1.0 ug/g Hg, wet weight, respectively). The sources of the Hg are unknown but may be attributable to aerial transport and deposition from combustion processes at industrial facilities within and outside the Great Lakes basin. Degradation of parent soils and bedrock may also be a local source of Hg. However, the 1987-88 data for Hg in fish were compromised by poor Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) practices by the laboratory contracted by the Patuxent Analytical Control Facility (PACF), U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. PACF reanalyzed a subset of the samples and confirmed the elevated levels of Hg in the fish. Due to the poor QA/QC practices by the contract laboratory and the limited sample size, ELFO concluded it would be premature to recommend altering the management direction at Seney NWR regarding access and consumption of fish by humans and wildlife. ELFO recommended that additional fish collections be undertaken for Hg analysis in the future. ELFO further recommended that if Hg continues to be a problem, then an expanded long term assessment of Hg in fish be implemented. This report documents the results of this expanded sampling effort as it relates to human consumption of fish from Seney NWR. The risks to fish-eating wildlife will be addressed in a separate report."

While productivity of eagles along the Columbia River is low, nesting success in other areas of the two states is close to the goals established to delist the species from the Federal Endangered Species list. Previous contaminant studies conducted from 1985 to 1987 along the river found poor productivity associated with elevated DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in eagle eggs. In addition, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) concentrations were found in five eggs collected in 1987 and 1991. From 1994-95, fresh bald eagle eggs were collected from nests in 19 of 43 occupied territories along the river. Eggshell thickness was determined on all eggs, and the contents were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides, total PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and planar PCBs (non-ortho and mono-ortho substituted congeners). Halogenated dioxin-like compounds in eggs were also evaluated based on a H4IIE rat hepatoma bioassay. Productivity and egg contaminant results from l 994 to 1995 were compared to a previous study to evaluate changes over time. Recent increases in productivity averages were due to new pairs nesting along the river, yet productivity at 23 older breeding areas remained low and was not different (P=0.713) between the two study periods. Eggshells averaged 11 percent thinner than shells measured prior to the use of the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), and thickness of eggs from older breeding territories had not improved (P=0.404) between the two study periods. Decreases in p,p'-DDE (P=0.022) and total PCBs (P= 0.0004) in eggs from older breeding areas occurred between the two study periods, but concentrations were still above values associated with poor productivity. TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs) exceeded estimated no-effect values for bald eagles during both studies. Bald eagle productivity over a five-year time period encompassing egg collection was not correlated to individual organochlorine compounds. Some dioxins, furans, planar PCBs, and TEQ values were correlated to nest location as river mile, with highest concentrations occurring at downriver breeding territories near the mouth. Although total productivity has increased due to the success of new nesting pairs moving into the region, results indicate that organochlorine contaminants continue to impact the breeding success of lower Columbia River eagles. The greatest impact of appears to occur at older breeding territories, which were located predominantly in the lower estuary below river mile 60. Eagles nesting toward the mouth of the river may be at greater risk of exposure to some dioxin-like compounds, and the reproductive success of some new pairs nesting in this area could be impacted in the future."

Significant continental-scale loss and degredation of wetlands led to establishment of some of the regions\u2019 largest wetland complexes as National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) and state Wildlife Management Areas (WMA). Effective management should focus on mimicking the wet-dry cycle of wetlands, which increases primary productivity by accelerating decomposition of accumulated detritus, releasing otherwise bound nutrients. Moreover, early seral stage wetland vegetation, e.g., sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), is often more nutritious and preferred by migratory birds than late-seral stage species more tolerant of anoxic conditions (e.g., watermilfoil [Myriophyllum sibiricum]). The frequency, timing, and duration of drawdowns are important factors in determining which vegetation community phases will be expressed within a wetland. General recommendations exist for assisting managers with this decision; however the predictive ability of conceptual models remains poor when applied at local scales.  The first component of this project is designed to reduce that management uncertainty by:    \u2022 Developing a conceptual wetland state-and-transition model (STM) to inform management    \u2013 Use existing literature to develop a draft STM for semi-permanently flooded wetlands (80% complete)    \u2013 Incorporate temporal scale using historical data collected during site visits    \u2022 Defining vegetation community phases within states using empirical data (25% complete)    \u2013 Ecological site descriptions and NVCS associations do not exist for wetland communities, necessitating this step    \u2013 Abiotic characteristics and indicator species for phases will be identified    \u2022 Designing an efficient monitoring scheme to inform management (15% complete)    \u2013 Determine wetland condition (i.e., state and phase) using vegetation community phase indicator species    \u2013 STM and current condition define potential management actions to either perpetuate the current state or move a system to another state    \u2022 Providing an analytical framework to estimate transition probabilities among states and phases at the local scale    \u2013 Monitoring of wetland response to management actions will allow estimation of transition probabilities among states and phases in response to management, i.e., reduce the uncertainty of predicted outcomes of water level manipulations in achieving desired states/phases.  Pilot field data collection to define states and community phases, describe relationships between phases and abiotic attributes, and identify indicator species for phases began at eight refuges in 2014. A spatially-balanced random sample of points within each wetland was visited. Canopy cover estimates of all wetland plant species and abiotic conditions (i.e., water depth, pH, salinity, specific conductivity, temperature, soil characteristics) were recorded. Data from 1434 sample points and 154 species were included in analyses to identify vegetation community phases and abiotic gradients correlated with phases. Two more field seasons following these methods will be used to design a long-term monitoring scheme, sustainable with expected station capacity, that will iteratively reduce the uncertainty of wetland management.    The second component of this project will be to link regional migratory bird objectives to local-scale management across the Intermountain West and western Prairie Pothole Region. This will facilitate coordinated wetland management across stations that provide important migrating and breeding habitat for migratory birds. Stations currently participating in the project include Bear Lake, Camas, Grays Lake, and Malheur NWRs in USFWS Region 1 and Bowdoin, Fish Springs, Lee Metcalf, and Medicine Lake NWRs in Region 6."

The State of Virginia's Department of Game & Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) maintains a policy of permitting deer hunting on an established deer herd. The presence of the deer herd requires hunting of that herd, especially if the habitats supporting that herd are low-quality (poor soils and limited forage). The Refuge supports this State policy. The current hunting areas at Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge meet this policy standard. An established deer herd has been existing within very limited, substandard (barrier island) habitats. This herd has been open to hunting since 1986. The feral hog is also open to hunting. It is not a naturally occurring wildlife species here. Instead, it is often considered a pest that consumes valuable wildlife food, disrupts wildlife habitat and threatens the dike system slopes with erosion damage where they root."

In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. Field activity information for this cruise is available on-line through the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geoscience Data System https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2005-004-FA."

Unit 9 has traditionally been known as a high nest production unit for waterfowl (ref.1) and requires less intense habitat maintenance, compared to other units, due to the unit\u2019s ability to recycle nutrients through water management. However, in recent years water volume that is needed for proper water management has been limited, for a number of reasons to include drought and funding shortages for pumping of wells. This has resulted in poor recycling of nutrients (i.e. breaking down of decedent vegetation), and encroachment of invasive plants species such as Tall White-top (Lepidium latifolium) and Canadian Thistle (Cirsium arvense).  Proposed management action called for a prescribed burn in this unit in attempts to: 1) remove decadent residual vegetation that is restricting new current year growth plants; 2) attempt to set back encroachment of invasive plant species that is occurring; 3) to allow for maintenance of irrigation infrastructure throughout the unit. The primary question that was raised was if the unit was burned, what would be the effects (if any) on nesting birds, and how long would the effect last? Other questions that were raised were, what \u201cother\u201d bird species are using this habitat, other than waterfowl, and what are their habitat requirements, and are they similar to waterfowl? A proposed 3 year survey project, (pre-burn year survey, burn year survey, and post-burn year survey), was developed to look at these questions."

In 1970, West Anacapa Island (WAI) was home to the last active colony in the California portion of the Southern California Bight (SCB), and that colony produced as few as 1 fledgling from 552 nest attempts.  The low fledging rate was due to poor hatch rates caused by eggshell thinning and breakage of eggs.  Eggshell thinning and possibly other impairments were attributed to exposure to organochlorine (OC) compounds, primarily DDE (a breakdown product of the pesticide DDT), and PCBs discharged into coastal waters and accumulated in the tissues of fish consumed by pelicans.  Data on eggs collected between 1970 and 1992 indicate that exposure by WAI pelicans to OC pesticides and PCBs started to decline in the 1970s when uses of many OC compounds in the United States were either curtailed or banned.  There were also corresponding increases in eggshell thickness and overall productivity of the WAI pelican colony.  Data on contaminant exposure by WAI pelicans had not been collected since 1992, when although thicker, eggshells still exhibited some thinning, concentrations of DDE in individual eggs still exceeded thresholds for crushing, and nest productivity was still below what was expected. This study was conducted to update the data on contaminant exposure by WAI pelicans, and to evaluate temporal trends and the potential role of contaminants as a limiting factor for productivity in the WAI colony."

Each investigator in the study used a different approach to assess potential contaminant impacts and develop a variety of information. Chemical residue analysis was performed to determine the concentration of metals in grab and trap sediment samples collected at 10 sites in the Basin. Results showed that metals concentrations were not elevated above biological criteria at any of the sites. Pore-water from the sediment samples was analyzed for general toxicity screening using the MicrotoxR toxicity test. Relatively low levels of toxicity were measured for most samples, except for one downriver site on the Clinch River and one site at the mouth of Copper Creek. A cellulolytic enzyme assay with Corbicula fluminea was used to assess physiological responses to metals in sediments at the same 10 sites. Results contrasting each site showed a response similar to the MicrotoxR test, indicating that the Clinch River site and Copper Creek site mentioned above had stress factors that also reduced Corbicula enzyme activity. Community structure of fish was considered using the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to analyze data collected at 42 sites in the Clinch Basin, Depressed IBI scores were not associated clearly with particular regions of the Clinch Basin (i.e., upper or lower) or predominant land uses (i.e., mining, agriculture). No Clinch River site scored below the \"Good\" range, but numerous tributaries were rated \"Fair\" or \"Poor.\" The only concentrations of \"Fair\" or \"Poor\" sites were in Big Cedar Creek and in the Guest River, respectively. Benthic macroinvertebrate community structure was quantified using the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) to analyze data collected at 13 sites in the Clinch Basin. The ICI results indicated most sites scored in the \"Fair\" or \"Good\" ranges, with two sites in the \"Excellent\" range and one in the \"Poor\" range. The only land use that was significantly (p <0.05) correlated with ICI data was an inverse relationship between taxa richness and percent coal mining. Future studies recommended to address sources of ecological stress in the Basin include land use characterization, biotic surveys, and surface water and sediment sampling. Toxicity testing may also be used to further delineate contaminant-specific impacts to biota."

                "text": "Immunoassay analysis of sediments from Maumee Bay for PCBs Until about 100 years ago the lower part of the Maumee River in northwest Ohio flowed through the Great Black Swamp, 7500 km2 of flat lowland forest (Francis et al. 1979). Water entering Lake Erie from the Maumee River was clear. The fish fauna of the area required water free of clayey silts and wild rice was abundant in Maumee Bay (Trautman 1981). In the period since the mid-1800s the area has been deforested, drained, and canalized for agriculture. Runoff from agriculture has caused the Maumee River to become very muddy with an annual sediment load to Lake Erie of 1,800,000 metric tons (Francis et al. 1979). Beds of inshore aquatic vegetation and spawning areas for many species of fish were destroyed by this sedimentation. Navigation channels in Maumee Bay must now be annually dredged at great expense. In terms of toxic contamination, Lake Erie is one of the cleanest of the Great Lakes. Its primary problem in the past has been eutrophication caused by phosphorus from agricultural fertilizers and waste water treatment plants. Waste water pollution has come under control in recent years, but agricultural non-point pollution remains a problem. Although Lake Erie is relatively clean, there is an Ohio fish consumption advisory in effect for carp and channel catfish. The advisory was established because these species appeared to contain residues of PCBs above the 2 ppm limit set by the Food and Drug Administration. This advisory was based on sketchy data, and the State of Ohio is currently conducting a more complete survey of contaminants in fish tissue. There has also been speculation that PCBs or other contaminants in the lake might be responsible for the poor reproductive performance of bald eagles that nest near Lake Erie. Tests of dredge spoil from Maumee Bay show relatively low concentrations of PCBs, but I am not aware of sediment studies from other parts of the bay. There is a possibility that past discharges of PCB laden oil from known sources on Otter Creek and Ottawa River entered Maumee Bay. A 1990 study by Ohio EPA showed levels of total PCBs in sediments of the Ottawa River to range from 0.71 to 110 ppm (Ohio EPA 1991). A tributary storm water runoff ditch that receives water from an industrialized area contained sediments with up to 1200 ppm of PCBs. PCB residues (mainly Aroclor 1248) in fish of the Ottawa River (whole body carp, length unspecified) ranged from 9.225 to 84.177 ppm. The concentration of PCBs (Aroclor 1248) in sediments from river mile 1 of the Ottawa River, the sample site nearest the mouth of the river, was 1.582 ppm. The purpose of this study was to survey the northern part of Maumee Bay for PCBs in sediment and in the process test out the new immunochemical PCB test kit technology. Discussion and Conclusion: Studies by Frank et al. (1977) found sediment PCB concentrations to be 2 or 3 times higher in depositional zones of the Great Lakes than in nondepositional zones. A study of Lake Michigan by Armstrong in 1981 also found that areas of recent sedimentation had the highest PCB concentrations and areas of scour had the lowest levels. Most of Maumee Bay is probably an area of sediment deposition. Frank et al. (1977) reported the highest sediment concentrations of PCBs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie to be 660 ng/g (ppb), 330 ng/g in the Central Basin, and 320 ng/g in the Eastern Basin. By these numbers the Maumee Basin sediment concentrations found in this study are very low, the highest concentration being 147 ng/g (0.147 ppm). The limitations of this study prevent confident conclusions. I can only conclude that samples of sediment from Maumee Bay probably contained less than 3 ppm of PCBs."

These reports summarize recent temperature and precipitation conditions and long-term trends at a variety of spatial scales, the smallest being the climate division level. Data at the climate division level are aggregated to compute statewide, regional and national snapshots of climate conditions. For CONUS, the period of record is from 1895-present. Derived quantities such as Standardized precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, and ZNDX) and degree days are also available for the CONUS sites.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project.   GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress WST.  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently.   GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.   This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size.   A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.   The GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the \"final\" GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.  There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 2c, Combined data, \"Set1\"   The \"individual\" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:          GSSTF_Fxx_2c, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)    The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_2c collection.     Please use these products with care and proper citations, i.e., properly indicating your applications with, e.g., \"using the combined 2001 data file of Set1\" or \"using the 2001 F13 data file\".

In addition to the three climate variables provided by the NEX-DCP30 dataset (minimum monthly temperature, maximum monthly temperature, and precipitation) a corresponding estimate of potential evapotranspiration (PET) was developed to match the spatial and temporal scales of the input dataset. PET represents the cumulative amount of water returned to the atmosphere due to evaporation from Earth\u2019s surface and plant transpiration under ideal circumstances (i.e., a vegetated surface shading the ground and unlimited water supply). PET was calculated using the Hamon PET equation (Hamon, 1961) and CBM model for daylength (Forsythe et al. 1995) for the 4 RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and organized by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall) and annually for the years 2006 \u2013 2099. Additionally, PET was calculated for the ensemble average of all historic runs and organized similarly for the years 1950 \u2013 2005. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://cds.nccs.nasa.gov/nex/) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

                "text": "AgAR (Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance) An Environmental Component of a \"One Health\" approach, the mission of the Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance (AgAR) project is to  develop practical tools and protocols to measure antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in agriculturally-impacted soil, water, air, and food;    design and evaluate agricultural best management practices to limit the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance from agroecosystems;    facilitate sharing of ideas and resources among ARS scientists by establishing an agency-wide network of researchers with the common goal of conducting science-based research on AgAR topics.  ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS: Which drugs are the most relevant for each type of ag production system?  At what level do excreted drugs continue to provide selective pressure in the environment?    RESISTANT BACTERIA: What is the relative contribution of specific bacteria to resistance in human clinical settings?  Are some bacteria more likely than others to donate or receive resistance genes?  What is the relative contribution of clonal spread of pathogens versus horizontal gene transfer?    RESISTANT GENES: How long do specific types of genes persist in agricultural samples?  What conditions increase or decrease the likelihood of a successful transfer in manure, soil, water, and air?  What is the role of the natural soil \"resistome\"?    AgAR Network Goals:  Connect ARS researchers at multiple locations in order to develop and assess methods for measuring resistance that are robust, and that are validated across production systems and geographical areas.    Identify which types of resistance are relevant to measure, based on an understanding of individual production systems and prioritized human health threats as identified by WHO and CDC    Encourage the collection of baseline data and control samples so that the impact of agricultural best management practices can be accurately determined.    Assess persistence of antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in environmental and pre-harvest settings.    Long term goal: Discover the details of how, and at what rate bacteria and genes move back and forth between animals and humans through agricultural systems (soil, water, air wildlife, insects, and food).  The AgAR network is composed of ARS scientists with an interest in understanding the ecology of antibiotic resistance in soil, water, air, insects, wildlife, and food. The network currently represents 4 national programs at 10 ARS locations across the United States, with over 200 peer-reviewed publications on AgAR topics, authored and co-authored by over 70 current and former ARS employees.    Activities:  Facilitate routine communication between AgAR members to address priority research areas, encourage agency and location wide collaboration and minimize research overlap.    Establish a framework for the cross-laboratory validation of AgAR methods.    Serve as a resource to scientists, stakeholders and administrators on current and past projects that address AgAR.    Provide a point of contact for agency coordinators to solicit information and transmit agency goals to relevant research groups.  Importance:    While there is broad agreement the use of antibiotics in food animals has the potential to adversely impact human clinical outcomes, the details of how this happens are unknown, and there is a critical need for information on antibiotic resistance (AR) in agricultural settings (AgAR).  U.S. and international health organizations have taken the lead on identifying specific antibiotic drugs and resistant infections that are critical to human health. ARS is uniquely positioned to provide information on the \"farm\" side of the \"farm to fork continuum\". ARS scientists are able to address these questions in a practical way, by combining their experience (over 200 peer-reviewed ARS publications on antibiotic resistance) with their applied understanding of agricultural production systems.    ORGANIZATION: Scientists work on their own, individual research projects. The AgAR network provides resources to participants to encourage collaboration across program areas and geographical location.    MANAGEMENT: The AgAR network is operated using a wiki community approach. All participating scientists are encouraged to contribute to and share in the community resources.   Currently, the group resources will be curated by the group coordinator, with input and guidance from a five person advisory panel.    RESOURCES: Bibliography of peer-reviewed AgAR papers by ARS authors \u2022 AgAR topic reference lists \u2022 information on  meetings and conferences  \u2022  \"AR_in_environment\" listserve \u2022  Community webinars"

Nineteen mountain lions (Felis concolor stan/eyana) were released into northern Florida as surrogates for evaluating the feasibility of reintroducing Florida panthers (F. c. coryi) into unoccupied areas of their historic range. These included I I females and 8 vasectomized males. Six of the released mountain lions were born and raised in captivity at Gillman Paper Company's White Oak Plantation near Yulee, Florida, I 0 were captured in the wild in western Texas and translocated to Florida, and 3 were captured in the wild in western Texas and held in captivity in Florida 2-8 years prior to release. Animals were monitored using radio-telemetry at least 3 days/week from 22 February 1993 to 30 June 1995. Fifteen lions established one or more home ranges. Nine (60%) home ranges overlapped one or more other home ranges. This population was made up of predominately captive-born and wildcaught/ captive-held animals in an area that varied in size from 127 to 418 km2 ( 1.5 to 3.1 lions/! 00 km 2 ). Mountain lions that established home ranges outside of this population had a higher excursion rate than did animals within it. Excursions were more frequent during the breeding season than during the rest of the year. Captive-raised animals tended to establish home ranges more quickly and were more likely to be in association with other animals than were wild-caught animals. However, captive-raised animals, particularly males, were more likely to be seen and caused most of the human/lion interactions that created negative attitudes toward the program. The mean distance from the release site to the home range center and the mean home range size were significantly greater for wild-caught males. Reestablishment of additional Florida panther populations is biologically feasible. It would require incorporating the advantages and planning around the disadvantages of both captive-raised and wild-caught translocated animals. However, complex social issues were identified that must be satisfactorily addressed, and it must be decided whether the tremendous costs involved (economic, political, social, etc.) in the reestablishment of additional Florida panther populations can be offset by the benefits gained in reducing the risk to the present Florida panther population."

Sargent County was forced to remove the old asphalt pavement due to the extensive deterioration as a result of high water and flooding. The road is now dirt/gravel. Many segments exhibit severe rutting. Speeds on the unpaved road are relatively low 30-40 mph, depending on the condition of the roadway. The county is in the process of raising the grade of the lowest segments in an attempt to keep the road open. There is a long-term effort by the county to reconstruct the roadway, raising the grade, placing gravel and paving with asphalt. There is currently no funding for this work. The county has applied for ER funding and is waiting to hear the status of that request. The three ER funding requests (3) total $330,000. Attached is an estimate provided by Interstate Engineering for the cost of rehabilitating the 5.5 mile segment of CR12. The estimate totals: $ X.X million. The current condition of CR 12 makes travel to and from the refuge difficult and potentially unsafe. It is in the best interests of the refuge to participate financially in the planned road work and by doing so, expedite the work. The level of NWR funding that would be appropriate for the improvement of CR 12 can be approached from a percent traffic generated by the refuge or a lump sum based on available funds."

The bTEFAP method identified 16S rDNA sequences in our samples which allowed the identification of various prokaryotic taxa associated with the life stage examined. This is the first comprehensive report of bacterial flora associated with the horn fly using a culture-independent method. Several rumen, environmental, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria associated with the horn fly were identified and quantified. This is the first report of the presence of Wolbachia in horn flies of USA origin and is the first report of the presence of Rikenella in an obligatory blood feeding insect.    Adult horn flies were collected on a single date from pastured cattle at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, St. Gabriel Research Station using aerial nets. Within 1 h after collection the flies were transferred to large sterile Erlenmeyer flasks and maintained in total darkness for 1.5 h and 30\u00b0C to allow flies to oviposit on the flask bottom [73]. Adult flies were released from the flasks into a cage and eggs were collected by rinsing with distilled water onto a filter paper. Both the eggs and adult flies were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. To preserve nucleic acid integrity, adults were sexed on dry ice prior to freezing. Each sample used for DNA extraction and pyrosequencing consisted of 5 adult males, 5 adult females or 50 eggs pooled together and homogenized. Three replicates of adult male, adult female and eggs were analyzed.    The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is one of the most economically important pests of cattle. Insecticides have been a major element of horn fly management programs. Growing concerns with insecticide resistance, insecticide residues on farm products, and non-availability of new generation insecticides, are serious issues for the livestock industry. Alternative horn fly control methods offer the promise to decrease the use of insecticides and reduce the amount of insecticide residues on livestock products and give an impetus to the organic livestock farming segment. The horn fly, an obligatory blood feeder, requires the help of microflora to supply additional nutrients and metabolize the blood meal. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing methodologies enable researchers to examine the microflora diversity independent of culture methods."

Additional information is needed about the spatial and dynamic interactions among plants, bison, elk (Cervus elaphus), and cattle (Bos taurus). More specifically, there is a need to assess and predict the carrying capacity of the winter ranges for bison and elk, and potential interactions among bison, elk, and cattle under different management scenarios on this potential winter range. This will require collection and synthesis of new and existing information about: 1) forage production and distribution, 2) snow cover, 3) interactions of bison with other species, especially elk, 4) bison and elk population dynamics, 5) bison and elk distribution, 6) habitat requirements, and 7) forage utilization. A spatial-dynamic model is recommended to estimate and predict carrying capacity and interspecific interactions.  The primary purpose of this proposed investigation is to use a combination of field data collection, ecological modeling, and synthesis to assess and predict the carrying capacity of native winter ranges for elk and bison and resultant interspecific interactions under different scenarios of supplemental feeding and other management tactics."

Only at refuges has wildlife conservation been legislated to have higher priority than either recreational or commercial activities. Presently, private ranchers and farmers graze cattle on 981,954 ha and harvest hay on 12.021 ha at 123 National Wildlife refuges. US Fish and Wildlife Service policy is to permit these uses primarily when needed to benefit refuge wildlife. to evaluate the success of this policy, I surveyed grassland management practices at 123 refuges. The survey results indicate that in fiscal year 1980 there were 374,849 animals unit months (AUMs)of cattle grazing, or 41% more than was reported by the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to the managers' opinions, 86 species of wildlife are positively affected and 82 are negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. However, quantitative field studies of the effect of cattle grazing or haying on wildlife coupled with the survey data on how refuge programs are implemented suggest that these activities are impeding the goal of wildlife conservation. Particular management problems uncovered by the survey include overgrazing of riparian habitats, wildlife mortality due to collisions with cattle fences, and mowing of migratory bird habitat during breeding season. Managers reported that they spend $919,740 administering cattle grazing and haying; thus refuge grazing and haying programs are also expensive. AT any single refuge these uses occupy up to 50% of refuge funds and 55% of staff time. In light of these results, prescribed burning may be a better wildlife management option than is either cattle grazing or haying."

The RBD program helped finance irrigation equipment, inputs, and extension services for plantain producers, as well as extension, inputs, and drying patios for rice producers in 2009 and 2010; the price of rice is a function of its moisture content, and by increasing access to drying patios the RBD program sought to increase the value of sales by producers. Using a unique data set collected for the evaluation, average impacts of the RBD program on participating plantain farmers were estimated using difference-in-differences, while average impacts of the rice component on beneficiaries were estimated using fixed effects regressions. Estimated program impacts were combined with administrative cost data to calculate an internal rate of return for the plantain program and for one aspect of the rice program (construction of drying patios).  Key results of the evaluation are:     -Estimated impacts suggest that the RBD rice program raised yields and revenues by 11% in the 2009 - 2010 growing season and 18% in 2010 - 2011 on average relative to the yields and revenues beneficiaries would have obtained without the program.     -The estimated ERR of the drying patio component of the RBD rice program ranges from 7% under the assumption of a five year lifespan for drying patios to 27% when assuming a 20 year lifespan.     -No ERR was estimated for the input/extension component of the rice program; part of the value of the extension/input bundles received by beneficiaries was to be paid back by each beneficiary farmer to his or her cooperative, and the sum total of payments was to serve as seed money for credit funds managed by cooperatives in future years. The  reliance of future benefits of this program component on farmer repayment performance makes its long-term value uncertain; therefore I chose to focus my ERR calculation on the drying patios.     -While average impacts and the drying patio ERR are both positive, RBD rice program impacts are estimated imprecisely, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that average impacts of the program on yields and revenues were zero.     -Estimated impacts of the RBD plantain program were large and significant for revenues and yields of first quality plantains (harvested plantains come in three different quality grades).     -The average impact of the RBD program on sales suggests that the program raised the value of plantain sales by 72% relative to what beneficiaries would have obtained without the RBD program.     -I use the estimated impact on revenues as well as administrative data on production costs and program costs to estimate the ERR of the plantain program.     -The plantain ERR ranges from -23% when assuming a lifespan of 5 years for irrigation equipment and 13% when assuming a lifespan of 20 years.     -The apparent discrepancy between large impacts on sales and the modest ERR is a reflection of the high cost per beneficiary of the program, which was around $15,062 per farmer for the cohort studied here (around $3.6 million divided by 239 beneficiaries)."

The lake from which the Refuge received its name has not contained water since the 1980s. In 1987, a Phase I contaminants investigation of the Refuge was conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arlington, Texas, Field Office. The results of this investigation indicated that elevated concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus compounds), salts, copper, strontium, and zinc were found in and downstream of cattle feedlot waste retention lagoons; Tierra Blanca Creek, the major lotic contributor of the Refuge, had degraded water quality, primarily attributed to run-off and discharges from cattle feedlots; and that nutrient concentrations retained in soils in the dry reservoir bed in Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge were elevated to the extent that inundation could create unacceptably high nutrient concentrations in the surface water. Consequentially, in 1993, a Phase II contaminants study was initiated at the Refuge by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to evaluate the extent of contamination in stormwater run-off entering the Refuge via Tierra Blanca Creek; to determine the extent of contamination in soils and vegetation within the Refuge; to evaluate the ability of crops grown in the Refuge to reduce soil contaminant concentrations; and to monitor contaminant levels in soils, surface water, and vegetation of moist soil management units constructed in the southern portion of the Refuge. To accomplish these objectives, surface water samples, representing a stormwater surge, were collected in Tierra Blanca Creek, upstream of the Refuge, analyzed for nutrient and total metal content, and compared with water data from the Phase I study and criteria values protective of aquatic life. Surface water, groundwater, soil, and biological samples were collected within the boundaries of the Refuge and analyzed for total metal and nutrient content. Data from these water analyses were compared with criteria and other screening values protective of aquatic life, while data obtained from the soils component of this study were compared with U.S. median background levels. The soil data were also statistically compared with data from the Phase I study to determine if contaminant levels had increased or decreased within the Refuge between 1987 and 1993. Biological samples consisting of vegetation and terrestrial invertebrates were analyzed for total metals. The resulting data from this portion of the study were statistically analyzed and compared with criteria protective of wildlife to determine the bioavailability of contaminants within the Refuge. In 1994, sediment and additional surface water, groundwater, soil, and biological samples were collected from the Refuge. The water samples were analyzed for dissolved metal and nutrient content. Soil and sediment samples were analyzed for total metal and nutrient content. Biological samples consisted of vegetation, aquatic macroinvertebrates, aquatic vertebrates, and avian specimens which were analyzed for total metals. In addition, sediment, soil, and biological samples were analyzed for total polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticide residues. Water, soils, sediment, and biological data resulting from these analyses were compared with criteria and screening values protective of wildlife resources to further interpret contaminant levels within the Refuge."

The model has been used to evaluate a wide variety of technologies and management strategies, and these analyses have been reported in the scientific and farm-trade literature. Systems research in dairy and beef production remains as the primary purpose of this tool, but the model also provides an effective teaching aid. With the model, students gain a better appreciation for the complexity of livestock forage systems. The learn how small changes affect many parts of the system, causing unanticipated results. They may also use the model to develop a more optimum food production system. When used in extension type teaching, producers can learn more about their farms and obtain information useful in strategic planning. By testing and comparing different options with the model, those offering the greatest economic benefit with acceptable environmental impact can be found.    Input information is supplied to the program through three parameter files. The farm parameter file contains data describing the farm such as crop areas, soil type, equipment and structures used, numbers of animals at various ages, harvest, tillage, and manure handling strategies, and prices for various farm inputs and outputs. The machinery file includes parameters for each machine available for use on a simulated farm.    Simulation output is available in four files, which contain summary tables, report tables, optional tables, and parameter tables. The summary tables provide average performance, environmental impact, costs, and returns for the years simulated. These values consist of crop yields, feeds produced, feeds bought and sold, manure produced, nutrient losses to the environment, production costs, income from products sold, and the net return or profitability of the farm. Values are provided for the average and standard deviation of each over all simulated years. The report tables provide extensive output information including all the data given in the summary tables. In these tables, values are given for each simulated year of weather as well as the mean and variance over all simulated years. Optional tables are available for a closer inspection of how the components of the full simulation are functioning. These tables include very detailed data, often on a daily basis. Parameter tables summarize the input parameters specified for a given simulation. These tables provide a convenient method of documenting the parameter settings used for a simulation."

MCC's investment in the agriculture sector included the Communal Land Support (CLS) Sub-Activity, to clarify and strengthen land rights and improve land use and management in the Northern Communal Area (NCA) of Namibia.  The CLS Sub-Activity was a $ 3,410,700 program that began in 2009, and concluded in 2014.  MCC commissioned an independent evaluation of CLS, which is being carried out by NORC at the University of Chicago (NORC).  This is a performance evaluation that uses qualitative data collection and analysis to assess the effects of CLS activity components on land administration in Namibia, as well as for beneficiaries on the ground.  The present report presents the results of an Initial Performance Evaluation (IPE) focusing on four sets of relatively short-term outcomes that would be expected to occur shortly after the conclusion of the project.  These are increasing knowledge and awareness about land rights, fostering effective policy dialogue, establishing processes, procedures, and tools that have been adopted by the Ministry of Lands and Resettlement (MLR), and improving tenure security for beneficiaries.  A potential subsequent Follow-On Performance Evaluation may address longer-term outcomes such as economic benefits resulting from improved range management and investment, as well as the sustainability of CLS.  Evaluation Questions:         How has CLS contributed to increasing knowledge and awareness about land rights, laws, and procedures in the CLRA?    1a) Do individuals know what land registration means?  Are they aware of their responsibility to register land or their rights and responsibilities to participate in community-level land management?  Are they aware of the obligation various levels of leadership have under the Land Act?  Are they aware of the venues for appealing land decisions?  To what extent have the communication and civic education components of CLS contributed to individuals' understanding of these issues? Have the CLS outreach and communication activities changed citizens' views about land issues, and if so how?  1b) Do authorities with responsibilities under the CLRA (including local community leaders, TAs, CLBs, and MLR officials) understand (i) land rights under the CLRA as well as (ii) their roles and responsibilities under the law?  Are they capable of carrying out those responsibilities?  To what extent has this understanding improved as a result of the CLS training activities?  1c) To what extent have female land users and authorities/leaders roles changed as compared to prior to CLS?   To what extent are they more empowered and effective? To what extent is this due to CLS?  1d) How do individual land holders assess the performance of various authorities (TAs, MLR officials, etc.) in their roles under the Land Act?         To what extent was the support for policy dialogue provided by CLS effective?    2a) In the priority policy areas in which CLS support focused, what changes in legislation, regulations, or procedures have been adopted?  2b) To what extent were CLS's priority policy areas focused on underlying sources of problems for the holders of rights on the ground, as opposed to issues that may not bring benefits to land users?  2c) To what extent has CLS, its support for policy dialogue, and its outreach and communications campaigns contributed to or changed the debate about land issues in Namibia?         To what extent has CLS had broader impacts on the approach to land registration in Namibia?    3a) In what ways do the various components of the CLS approach to land administration reflect improvements over previous approaches to land registration in Namibia along the dimensions of  transparency, accountability, cost effectiveness, quality and accessibility of information, and/or sustainability?    3b) To what extent did CLS result in changes to the registration process followed by the MLR?  To what extent are these changes sustained over time?   3c) Are there aspects of CLS that reflect improvements over previous approaches along dimensions of transparency, accountability, cost effectiveness, quality and accessibility of information, and/or sustainability, but were not adopted by MLR?  If so, what are these aspects and why didn't the MLR adopt them?  3d) Did procedures introduced by CLS improve the inclusion and participation of residents and landholders in land registration and land management processes?  Did procedures result in the perception of increased transparency and accountability?         How and to what extent has CLS helped improve perceptions related to tenure security? To what extent has CLS helped to improve tenure security for women and other vulnerable groups?    4a) To what extent do holders of land rights in the NCAs perceive those rights as secure?  What are the main sources of tenure insecurity?   How have these perceptions changed since implementation of CLS, and to what extent were they affected by CLS?  How do these perceptions differ among different types of land users, as well as women, the poor, and vulnerable groups?  4b) What kinds of land disputes are common, and how prevalent are they?  How has the prevalence of various types of disputes increased or decreased over time, and to what extent is CLS responsible for any changes?  How do these perceptions differ among different types of land users, as well as women, the poor, and vulnerable groups?  4c) How has the capacity of authorities (i.e., TA, CLBs) to resolve land disputes changed as a result of CLS?   4d) Has CLS led to a greater sense of empowerment and control for women over household land resources?  Did joint application forms have an effect on spousal rights?  4e) What are the perceived benefits and drawbacks (if any) of registering land and obtaining leaseholds?  The key findings for each evaluation question as well as some additional findings are summarized as follows:  Evaluation Question 1: How has CLS contributed to increasing knowledge and awareness about land rights, laws, and procedures in the CLRA?  \u2022   Nearly all of our NCA resident focus groups were able to collectively demonstrate a solid understanding of the process of land registration, though there were some individuals who expressed concern over their level of understanding about land issues, particularly grazing rights. \u2022   NCA residents' credit communications and outreach campaigns with improving their understanding of land issues, while land officials in the NCAs also felt that CLS outreach and communications had an impact in improving residents understanding on land issues.     \u2022   CLS employed multiple channels of information transmission in communications campaigns which was important.    \u2022   The results of the Quantitative Knowledge Assessment Tool (QKAT) show that nearly all respondents understood that the duration of customary land rights is not limited, and that the Traditional Authority has the responsibility to give grazing rights. However, only one respondent understood that parcels in excess of 50 ha can be registered as leaseholds only. NCA officials express mixed confidence in their understanding of the CLRA and their ability to carry out those functions.  NCA residents have mixed opinions about the capacity of land officials at various levels. \u2022   NCA officials (MLR Staff, CLB members, and TAs) remembered the CLS training and viewed it as valuable.    \u2022   Awareness that women have the right to own land has improved over time, with outreach and communications campaigns including CLS making an important contribution.  Widows' land rights in particular have been strengthened considerably in recent years, with communications and outreach campaigns such as CLS making an important contribution.  Nonetheless, important limitations remain to understanding and protection of women's land rights.   Evaluation Question 2: To what extent was the support for policy dialogue provided by CLS effective?  \u2022   CLS created procedures and forms for joint registration of customary land rights for both husbands and wives, which made an important contribution to formalizing and protecting women's land rights.  However, at the time of the evaluation, joint titles had not yet been issued, which could affect longer-term outcomes.     \u2022   CLS had several other accomplishments related to policy dialogue, including creating the procedure for registering a parcel over 20 hectares, establishing minimum qualifications for Communal Land Boards that are in use by the MLR, and establishing a procedure to allow local communities to obtain \u201chead leases\u201d on land for tourism.    \u2022   CLS made progress towards broader registration of group land rights, but was not able to establish and institutionalize an approach to group registration. Guidelines were issued and discussions started, but grazing rights need to be adopted and certificates issued for longer term outcomes to be met.     \u2022   CLS fostered awareness and initiated dialogue around several important land policy issues, and the communications and outreach components helped to stimulate interest and awareness about land issues in the NCAs.  Evaluation Question 3: To what extent has CLS had broader impacts on the approach to land registration in Namibia?  \u2022   On the whole, the tools and procedures developed by CLS are considered improvements over previous approaches and most are in use by the MLR.  CLS's approach of engaging closely with the communities also served to demonstrate the value of a participatory approach and made an impression on MLR staff. \u2022   CLS was effective in working closely with the MLR to facilitate take-up of the CLS tools and procedures.    \u2022   The NCLAS-2 land information system presented some challenges and has not been fully rolled out, although it appears the MLR still intends to adopt NCLAS-2.   Evaluation Question 4: How and to what extent has CLS helped improve perceptions of tenure security? To what extent has CLS helped to improve perceptions of tenure security for women and other vulnerable groups?  \u2022   Fear of government expropriation over leaseholds and mistrust of the village headperson were the most common sources of individual tenure insecurity cited by our respondents, though most respondents express confidence in their land rights.     \u2022   There were no gains in tenure security for grazing or commonage and this remains a point of confusion for several NCA residents.     \u2022   Most respondents felt that CLS mapping and registration had improved the security of their land rights, particularly so for women.    \u2022   The CLS mapping and registration process has led to an increase in land conflicts in the short term in some cases, but over time CLS certification is expected to decrease incidence of land conflict. \u2022   Land certification has improved women's empowerment, particularly with respect to protecting widow's rights.    Additional Findings    \u2022   In the areas where CLS did mapping and verification, many residents reported that they had not yet received their certificates.    \u2022   The most frequently cited land-related concern by our NCA resident respondents was decreasing availability of commonage land on which to graze cattle."

The presence and spread of these genes in non-clinical and non-agricultural environments has created the need for background investigations to enhance our understanding of the magnitude and risks associated with this emerging field (Allen and others, 2010). The current global economic costs of antibiotic resistant microorganisms is about 5.8 trillion USD, which is approximately equivalent to the combined GDP of Germany and the United Kingdom (Taylor and others, 2014). In this study researchers screened soil and sediment samples for the presence of 15 antibiotic resistance gene targets and 5 species of Vibrio (a marker of marine inundation) to determine natural background concentrations. These data provide a foundation to address background prevalence of these genetic targets in the northeastern United States (U.S.) to address regional influences (sources of pollutants) and to contrast future influences due to sea-level rise and large scale storms."

The land transaction (purchase, rentals, and mortgage) is an indicator of land market growth and will be measured using the administrative records at Land Administration Units (LAUs). The \u201cDUAT transaction\u201d time is defined as the time period between DUAT application and issuance by municipality offices and indicator of efficiency in providing land administration services. To achieve this objective, data from two different sources was obtained, including district and municipalities. In the municipalities, data was retrieved from the land administrative offices records in 16 municipalities (9 treatment and 7 control sites). Essentially, records on land registration was retrieved, copied to PDFs and entered into digital form. The second data source is the administrative data obtained from the provincial land administrative offices (SPGCs) in the four provinces in North-Central Mozambique where the Millennium Challenge Account implemented its land tenure project. Note that, data obtained in the districts was in digital form (Access) converted to Stata for analysis.  A total of 11,311 land titles were compiled from the existing records from the two data sources."

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2017, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS)."

These boundary files are specifically designed for                   small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the                   intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain                   the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may                   not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as                   nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files. The                   cartographic boundary files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and                   census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is                   established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as                   opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide                   services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places                   always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision                   boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but                   can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as                   the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide                   data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are                   not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The                   boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal                   officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent                   incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one                   decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development;                   a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same                   boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must                   contain some housing and population."

Local-scale deposition (e.g., Maine chlor-alkali plant and municipal waste incinerators), long-range transport deposition (e.g., from the Midwest), and increasing global atmospheric reservoirs all contribute to Hg availability on Maine's landscape. Recent geographic studies indicate that Maine's Common Loon and Bald Eagle breeding population are exposed to some of the highest levels of methylmercury (MeHg) in North America. We quantified the extent of Hg availability for five piscivorous birds on 92 lakes across Maine. All species exhibited elevated levels of Hg in their blood, feathers, and eggs. The Common Loon was the species most widely represented and adults showed the highest levels of Hg exposure. Our non-random sampling of Maine lakes prevented a statewide assessment of risk. However, Hg levels in Common Loons indicate that 31% of the adult males, 30% of the juveniles, 24% of the eggs, and 10% of the adult females exceeded impact thresholds determined by laboratory and in situ studies. Based upon data from previous studies, 48% of juvenile Bald Eagles were at risk. Interior nesting pairs of eagles had Hg concentrations over 6 times higher than coastal or riverine pairs. Osprey Hg concentrations were also higher on interior lakes but were significantly lower than eagle Hg levels. The calculated uptake of dietary MeHg is considered to be 3-4 times higher in the Belted Kingfisher than the other target piscivorous birds and was apparent on Flagstaff Lake when compared to young loons and mergansers. Common Mergansers sampled also exhibited high exposure to Hg. There were few indications of statewide geographic patterns in MeHg availability except that marine habitats tended to have significantly lower levels than interior Maine. There was also an apparent effect from atmospheric Hg being deposited downwind of the Orrington area as indicated by loon blood and egg samples. Lake morphometric and water chemistry Hg patterns were not readily apparent dictating the need for a lake to lake sampling scheme. We developed an index that included each species and matrix sampled. It indicated that a majority of Maine lakes sampled generate enough MeHg to cause moderate to high risk to loons (50%) and the piscivorous bird community (70%)."

The site model files provided include both calibrated and uncalibrated simulations of various steady-state and transient hydrologic conditions. Simulations were accomplished with equivalent porous media models that allow laminar flow only (MODFLOW) or laminar and non-laminar flow in a model layer (MODFLOW-CFP mode 2) and hybrid model simulations (MODFLOW-CFP mode 1 one-dimensional pipe network linked to equivalent porous media model). The test examples of the application of equivalent porous media model (the sponge) with and without turbulence and a hybrid model (sponge with pipes) to the Woodville Karst Plain near Tallahassee, Florida, indicated that for annual, monthly, or seasonal average hydrologic conditions, all methods met calibration criteria (matched observed water levels and average flow). Thus, the increased effort, such as the collection of data on conduit location and the computational time of a hybrid model, is not necessary for simulation of average hydrologic conditions (simulation of non-laminar flow was not critical). However, simulation of a large storm event in the Woodville Karst Plain with daily stress periods (52-day period beginning August 13, 2008) indicated that turbulence is important for matching daily springflow hydrographs and models calibrated to average conditions did not match daily storm spring hydrographs. All models were developed from an equivalent porous media model for the area calibrated by J.

It remains one of the last strongholds for the federally endangered clubshell mussel (Pleurobema clava) in addition to several other mussel and fish species. Protection of this resource is extremely important, not only to preserve current diversity, but for the potential recovery of several species of mussels. The leading cause of imperilment for freshwater mussels is habitat destruction and degradation caused by anthropogenic activities (Williams et al. 1993). The Tippecanoe River is subject to a variety of these environmental stresses including industrial and municipal effluent, urban run-off, non-point source pollution from agricultural practices, and erosion and sedimentation as a result of physical alterations of tributaries and riparian habitat. This investigation was initiated after a decline in mussel richness and diversity was observed in the Tippecanoe River watershed. This decline included a loss of rare and sensitive species in most of the river's tributaries (ESI 1993). The study focused primarily on the effects that permitted municipal and industrial discharges had on the rare and endangered mussel fauna in the main stem Tippecanoe River. It was evident from past studies (ESI 1993) that many of the tributaries no longer supported their historical mussel fauna. Because most of the permitted NPDES and solid waste facilities discharge to the tributaries, as opposed to the river itself, a logical assumption was that these facilities were having adverse impacts on the Tippecanoe River watershed. The objective of the study was to identify those point sources that appeared to be negatively affecting the main stem river via chemical degradation of water and sediment. A variety of surveys, tests, and analyses were performed and, though no one tributary stood out above the rest as being seriously problematic, several streams were implicated as contributing to a decline in water quality and increased sediment load. In addition, while point-source pollution in the watershed should not be taken lightly, results of this study indicate that a more serious threat to the freshwater mussel community in the Tippecanoe River may be non-point source pollution, such as urban runoff, agricultural chemical inputs, aerial deposition, and excessive erosion and sedimentation. This study addressed the number one priority of the Ohio River Valley Ecosystem Team (ORVET) which is to reverse the decline of native mollusks, with emphasis on endangered, threatened, and candidate species, and species of concern. In 1998, the ORVET designated the Tippecanoe River as a focus area based on its species richness and diversity. Data gathered during this project will provide valuable baseline information in the event a chemical spill or release was to occur in the watershed. In addition, this information will be useful in developing management strategies for the river."

In general, this territory consists of areas of                   high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the                   \"urban footprint.\" There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that                   contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500                   people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam                   which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban                   area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading                   zeroes. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana,                   these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the                   equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities,                   and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively                   for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states                   (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places                   that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions                   of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are                   treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of                   Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an                   equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the                   following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:                   Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in                   the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin                   Islands.

This network of wetlands, forests, and grasslands has also provided habitat for a variety of fish and resident wildlife species. The Upper Mississippi River (UMR)    floodplain has been greatly altered for agriculture, urbanization, navigation and flood control. The quantity and quality of wildlife habitat on the River has declined. We believe that partnerships will play a key role in achieving the long-term ecological integrity of the UMR.  Cooperative working relationships between federal and state agencies, industry, and the public are crucial to achieving a balance between commercial navigation, recreation, River habitat for wildlife and safe municipal water. Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge Complex (Complex) lands will contribute to larger public policy goals regarding floodplain management. Research and monitoring data must be current, readily available, and applicable to land management decision-making needs. In the future, the Complex management program on 500 miles of the UMR will be an exemplary model for partnerships and science-based wildlife management.  The River will provide a mosaic of habitats to sustain healthy populations of native wildlife. Managed lands, such as those within the Complex, have become critical for the ecological sustainability of the UMR. A balanced program of habitat protection, enhancement, and restoration will consider overall habitat needs on the pool, reach, and watershed levels. The Complex will provide high-quality habitat along the UMR for migratory birds, other wildlife species, and fish. Management programs will be effectively monitored for success and adapted and modified as new scientific information becomes available.  While wildlife management remains the primary purpose of the Refuge Complex, compatible public use and enjoyment of those resources is also important. The Complex will provide an array of environmental and wildlife education programs and wildlife dependent recreational activities. Habitat management programs and public use facilities will attract thousands of visitors annually. The partnership with the Army Corps of Engineers involving the Riverlands Project Area provides an opportunity for conducting a quality off-refuge wildlife education and interpretation program within a large metropolitan area. Local communities will appreciate the role of the Service in managing quality wildlife habitat and contributing to improved floodplain factors such as flood water storage and helping to provide for clean, safe water in the River corridor."

The site is approximately two acres and is located in Section 1, Township 9 south, Range 8 west, City of Apalachicola, Franklin County, Florida. The site is currently the property of the City and could be transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if it is found acceptable and suitable for Service needs. One consideration involves past usage and the potential accumulation of chemical contaminants and other hazardous materials. As recently as about 1970, the site was utilized as a location for a municipal sewage treatment plant. As such, the facility had four clarifiers, four sludge drying beds, pumping equipment, and other apparatus as would normally be associated with such a plant (D.O.T. photography, 1972). Ultimately, the plant was closed and disassembled. Subsequent to municipal use of the site for sewage treatment, the area was used as a dump/storage area for a variety of items including 55 gallon drums, creosote impregnated pilings, metal scrap, vehicle parts, oyster shell, and at least one junked metal boat. Based on the above, it was determined that a chemical contaminant evaluation was proper before any acquisition activities were entered into."

Located approximately 10 miles from downtown Denver, the land (15,988 acres) within the boundary of Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge (RMANWR) has a well-documented history of significant environmental disturbance and contamination. The primary causes of degradation were the manufacture of chemical weapons by the U.S. Army from the World War II through Vietnam eras and the production of pesticides by Shell Chemical Company in the 1980's. Given the extent and type of degradation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified the need for these lands to be remediated in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, also commonly known as Superfund) to ensure standards for human health and the environment are met prior to transferring ownership to the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) for management as a National Wildlife Refuge. Remediation activities mandated under CERCLA will result in restoring approximately 67% (10,739 acres) of RMANWR lands to native short- and mixed-grass prairie. Other habitats that will be present on RMANWR include shrublands, forested lands, riparian areas, and numerous manmade features (irrigation lakes, ditches, homesteads, etc.), many of which are of cultural or historic importance. More than 300 species of wildlife have been documented on RMANWR, but many of these species occur in low numbers or are not observed frequently. To identify priority resources of concern, refuge staff compiled a list of species documented as priorities in various plans developed by national, regional, local, state, and private organizations and compared this list to species that currently use, or potentially could use RMANWR habitats. Species that exhibited significant overlap were selected as priority resources of concern and the habitat requirements (e.g., food, cover, area requirements) of these species formed the basis for HMP goals, objectives, and management strategies. However, habitat resources are limited given the size and isolated nature of the refuge; therefore, RMANWR staff used published scientific literature and professional expertise to identify potential conflicts and optimize conditions for these species within the context of BIDEH. Specifically, the goals and objectives of this HMP are designed to accomplish the following during the next 15 years (2013-2028): Promote successful long-term establishment and maintenance of seeded restoration sites, as well as existing native prairies and shrublands, to provide habitat for the resources of concern. Maintain the importance of RMANWR as a priority nesting site for burrowing owls (Athen cunicularia hypugaea) along the Front Range of Colorado. Preserve a historically representative population of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Provide additional nesting opportunities for resources of concern, including relevant grassland-dependent bird species exhibiting population declines. Maintain a bison (Bison bison) population that contributes to the Department of the Interior's Bison Conservation Initiative and helps maintain the structure and composition of native and restored prairies necessary to support priority grassland bird species. Provide habitat in the Educational Zone of the refuge for neo-tropical migratory bird species that are losing suitable stop-over areas to urban development in the Denver-metro area. Provide long-term quality nesting and roosting habitat for the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). As one of the nation's premier urban national wildlife refuges, the RMANWR provides a variety of unique public education opportunities."

There is little long term data on burrowing owl population trends in Colorado. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Breeding Bird survey data suggest a decline from 1966 to 1989 in the Colorado burrowing owl population and an increase from 1980 to 1989. However, both of these trends are not statistically significant and the validity of this data for long term trend analysis has been questioned (Barker 1991). While population declines over large areas have not been confirmed in Colorado, local population declines and potential causes have been identified. Loss of breeding habitat through control of prairie dogs, cultivation of grasslands and urbanization are suspected of causing population declines. In addition, pesticides may cause declines by reducing insect prey species, direct mortality of the birds, or reduced reproductive success. This study contains information about burrowing owl populations nested at the Denver International Airport (DIA) mitigation site and on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The purpose of this survey was to inventory breeding burrowing owl populations in the Central Region."

Each urban                   area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading                   zeroes. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana,                   these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the                   equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities,                   and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively                   for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states                   (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places                   that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions                   of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are                   treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of                   Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an                   equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the                   following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:                   Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in                   the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin                   Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is                   covered by counties or equivalent entities. The boundaries for counties and                   equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010."

Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high.

RMA biologists estimate the current deer population exceeds 900 animals (approximately 250-300 white-tailed deer and 650-700 mule deer). The Comprehensive Management Plan for the RMA, completed in 1996, states that the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will manage deer populations between 325 and 550 total deer. These goals were generally based on habitat conditions from the early 1990' s and deer research conducted on the refuge in the late 1980's (Matiatos pers. comm. 1999). A specific study evaluating carrying capacity of the habitats on the RMA had never been conducted. The current management approach is a conservative one that attempts to suppress deer populations and minimize habitat degradation by culling females. Culling may have suppressed populations somewhat, but the estimated total population is much higher than the current management goal. The large numerical span between the population estimate and the management goal indicates that habitats on the RMA may be able to support a much higher population of deer than was originally thought. Recognizing this need to evaluate the available habitats and create a more scientifically based method to estimate carrying capacity, the Service initiated this study."

Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

First, we calculate economic rates of return associated with reduced user costs for each rehabilitated road - and for the project in aggregate - making use of the before and after measures of road use, detailed data on project implementation and costs, and models that project changes in usage, costs, and benefits over time.   We also examine changes in the availability and cost of common consumption goods that can be attributed to the transportation project. This component of the analysis relies on a survey of retail establishments that targets goods in the Cansta Basica or basic basket that is used in Nicaragua to track consumer prices. Data was collected both before and after construction in communities both on and away from rehabilitated roads. The survey design therefore facilitates measurement of changes in price and availability of goods relative to a relevant comparison group.   The evaluation also examines changes in household consumption using a similar pre- and post- rehabilitation data collection methodology. The consumption measures for this component of the evaluation are derived from responses to household surveys implemented for the Rural Business Development (RBD) portion of the Nicaragua compact. While the bulk of the respondents to this survey are outside the zone of influence of the road rehabilitation, we identify more than one-hundred households within the zone of influence of the rehabilitated roads. It is important to recognize that the data for this component of the report was collected for a different purpose and respondents are not a representative sample of households in the treatment and control areas. Thus these results are intended to be suggestive and provide some insight on the robustness of results from the survey of retail establishments. These surveys do not provide unbiased estimates of the transportation project on the affected population."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

For example, the Federal Trade Commission staff report relied upon by Citizen Action actually concludes that variation in market shares \"is suggestive of a lack of coordination among majors\" in gasoline retailing. More recent studies by the EIA and DOE support the position that gasoline markets are competitive and that gasoline market prices respond to ordinary supply and demand factors unaffected by seller concentration. Mr. Tom Potter, Sr., testifying on behalf of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, concludes, \". . .the gasoline marketplace is exhibiting the normal characteristics of a free market premised on factors associated with supply and demand.\" At the core of the Citizen Action report is the hypothesis that higher than average gasoline prices are caused by higher than average seller concentration.

In 1993, the level of resolution of reproductive performance was improved with the initiation of a program to uniquely color-mark individuals.  Since 1976, the number of territorial pairs has increased from 9 to 28 and reflects a similar increase in loon populations across New Hampshire. However, long-term reproductive measures indicate two major concerns for loon conservation.  First, the number of fledged young per territorial pair has significantly declined in the past four years (0.28) and is well below the 24- year mean for Lake Umbagog (0.46).  Second, the discrepancy of reproductive measures between the north and south ends of the lake continue to widen.  Observations of marked individuals indicate site fidelity (84.5%) and survivorship (93.5%) are above or near average levels of other breeding populations, thereby indicating density dependent factors are not the sole source of impacts for current loon demographics. Water level manipulation and methylmercury availability were investigated and found to be potential sources of impact on healthy breeding populations.  Although mean mercury exposure to loons and their prey fish on Lake Umbagog are moderate compared to watershed-wide levels, certain areas of the lake such as the southern end and the Magalloway River carry Hg loads potentially damaging at the molecular, organism, and population levels. The changes in water levels have a dual effect on the viability of Lake Umbagog\u2019s loon population. Although positive steps have been taken to minimize waterlevel impacts on loon nesting success, 13% of their nests in the past seven years failed due to floodings and strandings. Changes in water levels, especially during the summer, are also known to exaggerate methylmercury production and create artificially high levels."

There is currently no guidance on  where deviations were made from the original plan - further information will be required  on this to complete the evaluation.     1. Engineering Analysis and Economic Modelling     a. The methodology for assessing the quality of existing data, and a plan for updating data     collection required for modelling purposes. This determines the road map for how the  contractor plans to meet the data-quality level specified (i.e. IQL-2) and what protocol for  roadside data collection to include.     b. The methodology for determining the HDM-4 assumptions used to model costs and  benefits, including options for improving assumptions (e.g. Comparing past investment     trends against overall asset quality over time).     c. The approach used to review MCC's modelling of the ex-ante performance of the     infrastructure. This review will inform the model's parameters and re-adjust assumptions  where needed. d. The proposed methodology and assumptions to be used to update the project's Economic  Rate-of-Return (ERR) calculations.     2. Maintenance     a. A descriptive review and technical assessment of the road authority's maintenance     practices, including a comparison of the road authority's administrative records and reports  of maintenance resources, for both elements of RRP.     b. A Political economy analysis of road maintenance and improvement in investment  decisions (planning, budgeting, implementation and oversight relative to the road  authority's program for the infrastructure).     3. Road Usage Patterns     a. A methodology for estimating traffic composition along each road element. It includes     road-user representative estimates of changes in travel times and transport costs.     b. An assessment of the costs and value of gathering origin- destination (O-D) evidence (O-D     vehicle intercept surveys versus other methods for gathering road usage data on relevant  road segments)     c. An assessment of the changes in road usage patterns through retrospective data collection.  d. An exploration of changes in the structure of transportation demand, including addressing     whether changes have occurred as a result of MCC road investments or due to unrelated  factors.     4. Transportation Market Structure     a. An evaluation of the Senegalese transport market structure and the institutions that     regulate and govern it, including possible noncompetitive market behavior. This includes a  literature review summarizing the current evidence for the institutional structure of the  Senegalese transport industry, and how it is regulated.     b. An efficiency analysis of the commercial road-transport industry and how changes in  vehicle operating costs (VOCs) affect costs and purchaser pricing and how political- economy factors affect cost-savings pass through."

Three primary objectives of the trapping program on Felsenthal NWR Complex are: 1. To allow public to utilize a renewable natural resource. 2. To provide opportunities for wildlife-oriented outdoor recreation. 3. To maintain the overall furbearer population at acceptable levels.   The total number of raccoons taken was unfortunately down by 262, directly reflecting the reduced effort resulting from low fur prices."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

                "text": "Data from: Defensive aphid symbiont Hamiltonella defensa effects on Aphelinus glycinis and Aphelinus atriplicis Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa /APSE by two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.    Insect sources and rearing conditions    Aphelinus glycinis was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect Aphis craccivora or Acyrthosiphon pisum because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.    Aphis craccivora is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Acyrthosiphon pisum is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Aphis craccivora in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and Ac. pisum were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, Vicia faba L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in H. defensa in Ac. pisum and APSE type 4 was found in H. defensa in Ap. craccivora. Aphid lines without H. defensa were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on V. fava plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of H. defensa from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from Ap. craccivora and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from Ac. craccivora were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of H. defensa and APSE prior to assays.    Aphelinus atriplicis was collected as mummified Diuraphis noxia on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; A. glycinis was collected as mummified Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. Aphelinus glycinis was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); A. atriplicis was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the Aphelinus varipes complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. Aphelinus atriplicis was reared on D. noxia on barley, Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae); Aphelinus glycinis was reared on Aphis glycines on soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of A. glycines was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither D. noxia nor A. glycines are known to harbor H. defensa, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of H. defensa in our colonies of these species. Although A. glycines harbors another bacterium, Arsenophonus, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.    Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with Hamiltonella defensa versus uninfected aphids    To measure the effect of infection with H. defensa harboring APSE on parasitism of Ap. craccivora and Ac. craccivora, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of Aphelinus atriplicis or Aphelinus glycinis that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with H. defensa or uninfected aphids on V. faba variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. Aphelinus females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.    The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.    Aphids parasitized by these Aphelinus species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.    Design structure    The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for Aphelinus glycinis on Ap. craccivora and Aphelinus atriplicis on Ap. craccivora and on Ac. pisum (24 each for Hamiltonella-infected versus uninfected aphids)."

In this paper I examine foraging behavior of Piping Plover to determine factors that affect the time plovers devote to foraging. Objectives of the study were to determine: (1) where Piping Plovers foraged, (2) time devoted to foraging as a function of nesting beach, reproductive stage and brood size, and (3) the effect of human activities on foraging time. Piping Plovers are ideal for such an examination because they nest solitarily on barrier beach islands that have suffered from increased human development and recreational activities. I examined foraging behavior because clutch size) and nest sites do not seem to be causing population declines. Thus I wanted to determine whether Piping Plover experienced difficulties foraging because of people. Reproductive success is lower in areas with high human disturbance. Foraging behavior of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) was studied using a focal animal approach from 1985-1986. Time devoted to foraging decreased as vigilance (time devoted to being alert) increased. Variations in vigilance were explained by beach, reproductive stage, brood size, time of day, and number of people nearby. Overall, Piping Plovers foraged from 46-79 sec., were alert for 14-57 sec., and displayed or ran from people for 1-8 sec. in the 2 min. samples. Plovers at sites less disturbed by people (Little Beach, Holgate) generally devoted more time to foraging and less time to vigilance than birds at the other sites. Time devoted to foraging was generally higher In May, lower in June, and increased again in July. Plovers that were incubating or caring for chicks spent less time foraging than those that had lost their chicks. Chicks spent less time foraging and more time being alert, running, and crouching than did their parents foraging during the same time periods. With increasing brood size, chicks spent less time foraging and more time running or crouching although the number of people nearby did not vary. Behavior was correlated within members of a pair: birds spent less time foraging as their mates increased time devoted to alertness, being off the nest, or displaying. When brooding birds increased alert time, their mates increased their alertness and displaying, and decreased foraging time. As the number of people near foraging plovers increased, time devoted to running and crouching increased and time devoted to feeding decreased. It appears that the presence of people is stressful for breeding adults and chicks, forcing them to spend significantly less time foraging, perhaps accounting for decreased overall reproductive success."

Pre-post comparison of time and cost involving in select land-based transactions    2. Involve two main instruments of measurement: Back Office time tracking survey and the Banking survey    3. Qualitative interviews were conducted with registry officers to inform the understanding of how these measures affected workflow  Evaluation question:     Did some of the institutional strengthening activities of PRP reduce time and cost of completing land-based transactions?   The institutional strengthening activities that can be evaluated are the installation of web-based electronic registry system (ePRS), the revision to law that govern access to property records law, and the digitization of paper archives.   Results:     Back Office Time Tracking survey - Tracked 9 land based transactions at General Authority of State Registry (GASR) - Shortest process, registering a collateral agreement took 6 work days. Longest process, registering land or structure on land took 12 days. Transactions took 3-6 days longer than official time posted by GASR.   Banking survey - Tracked time it takes to apply for a mortgage or land-based loan including time it takes to prepare document, to submit and wait for bank approval, and to visit GASR offices to register for the mortgage or loan. Mortgage - 25 days for loan process and 14 days to prepare paperwork for loan application, total cost 360 USD. For land based loan - took 13 days for the loan process and 7.5 days to prepare paperwork, total cost 130 USD.   Informational interviews - Mixed responses. All officers agree that there has been changes to the registration flow. However, lack of consensus on whether the changes have shortened the weight time for citizens. While opening of district offices have shortened travel distance for some citizens, multiple locations meant that documents had to travel to the main office for official signatures. All officers agreed that workload increased yet workforce did not. There was consensus that more people are registering due to increased awareness and growing construction sector. Officers also noted that government mandated 8% mortgage has increased demand for mortgages. Officers agree that technical upgrades provided by PRP have improved efficiency and that outreach activity had educated the public regarding property rights.   CLOUDBURST GROUP:    Evaluation design: Performance Evaluation  This is a follow-up endline evaluation that adapts an existing evaluation design developed by IPA. Five research questions drive this follow-up evaluation:  1) Did the land registry system strengthening component of the PRP lead to increases in demand and volume of formal land transactions, including land registration and related transfers at GAIPSR and mortgages at the banks?    2) What were the characteristics of those who conducted formal land transactions before and after the introduction of ePRS?    3) Did the land registry system strengthening component of the PRP result in changes in land transaction costs/time for land transactions?    4) Were there changes in gender ratio of land owners? Were there any differences in results for parcels held by women/men?    5) Did the land registry system strengthening component of the PRP lead to improvement in quality of property registration services? What was the significance of the land registry system strengthening component of the PRP?  This follow-up evaluation draws upon six main sources of primary and secondary data to answer the evaluation questions: ePRS land transaction data, pre-ePRS land transaction data, a banking customer survey, structured key informant interviews (KIIs) with GAIPSR registrars and bank loan officers, focus group discussions (FGDs) with key beneficiary groups, and open-ended KIIs with key project stakeholders. In addition, the evaluation will produce a final ERR calculation of this activity of the PRP based on the main expected benefit streams.   The PRP took place from 2008 to 2013, so this follow-up endline evaluation is occurring approximately five years after the close of project activities."

It has been prepared under the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, P.L. 85-624 Section 2(b), and in keeping with the spirit and intent of the National Environmental Policy Act. It also serves as section 7 consultation pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, and no further consultation is necessary. This report will accompany the Corps' Feasibility Stage Detailed Report and environmental statement to the Commander of the U.S. Army Engineer - Civil Works Planning Office for construction approval and funding for plans and specifications. Bank erosion is a perennial problem along the Yukon River in Emmonak, Alaska, and threatens the road between the village and the airport. The village of Emmonak requested assistance under section 14 of the 1946 Flood Control Act (P.L. 79-562 [33 u.s.c. 701r] as amended by P.L. 93-251). The purposes of the service in study involvement are to 1) evaluate the potential impacts of each alternative on fish and wildlife resources and their habitats; and 2) recommend methods for mitigating adverse impacts and/or enhancing these resources. The Service's findings are based on a site visit 1-2 June 1994, a literature review and coordination with the Corps' Environmental Resources Section. The National Marine Fisheries Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game provided no comments on the draft report. All previous Service documents are superseded by this document."

Its 175 residents, most of whom are lflupiaq speaking Eskimos, have strong cultural links to lands in and adjacent to the northern part of the refuge and are culturally and economically dependent on the refuge's wildlife resources. Kaktovik is one of the eight villages belonging to the North Slope Borough, which is the regional governing entity headquartered in Barrow. Modern in many respects, there is also ample evidence of its dependence on the land's resources. New pick-up trucks are parked next to piles of whale maktak. Racks of drying ugruk meat extend from just completed modern four bedroom houses, and caribou hides are draped over snowmachines parked in front yards. North Slope Borough construction and services offer jobs where residents are regularly employed, but work schedules are flexible enough to allow for subsistence activities, and people hunt and fish on weekends and during vacations. Continuing petroleum development on the North Slope and its possible extension to the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge have focused attention on the people of Kaktovik and their subsistence way of life. In order to make optimum resource allocation decisions and minimize petroleum related impacts, it is important to know as much as possible about these peoples' past and present uses of the land and wildlife and the values associated with these uses. This report documents, from the viewpoint of the people of Kaktovik, historic and present land use and associated values in the general area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."

The objective of this introduction was to provide an alternative food source for Native people during times of wildlife shortages. By 1930 there were some 650,000 reindeer in western and northern Alaska. Overgrazing of ranges, straying with caribou, predation, and economic, social and political factors led to a sharp decline in reindeer populations during the 1930's. The Reindeer Act of 1937 established Natives as sole owners of Alaskan reindeer and assigned support responsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior. In spite of this action, reindeer numbers have remained at a relatively low level. Today, there are approximately 30 thousand reindeer in Alaska. A majority of the herds occur on the Seward Peninsula while smaller numbers of reindeer persist on Nunivak, St. Lawrence, Hagemeister, Kodiak, Umnak, Atka and St. Paul Islands. Reindeer herding on the Seward Peninsula and Nunivak Island continue to provide red meat at a relatively low cost to local people."

We used the Puget Sound beach seining protocol (Simenstad and others, 1991) to sample fish populations in the Elwha River estuary complex. The beach seine was 38 m long x 2 m deep, with a 2 m x 2 m bag in the center of the net; mesh size was 3.18 mm, 6.35 mm, and 31.75 mm, for the bag, center panel, and wings, respectively. The seine net was deployed from bank to bank by a small skiff and then pulled on shore. The number of seines conducted each month varied based on estuary conditions and staff availability. Captured fish were quickly transferred to 20-liter plastic buckets filled with aerated estuary water, individually identified, counted, measured, and released at the point of capture. The locations of seines were determined with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS). Fish abundance is reported as catch per unit effort (CPUE), calculated as the total number of each fish species caught in all seines at each site and date, divided by the number of seines conducted.

Hunters from 13 villages killed polar bears during this period. The documented minimum polar bear harvest for 1980/81 and 1981/82 hunting seasons were 106 and 90, respectively. A minimum of 21 bears were harvested from January 1 to July 30, 1980 (ADF&G records) and have been included in the pooled sample of 217 killed bears. Of this total, 134 (61.8%) were bears for which complete sex and age information was obtained; 52 (23.9%) were bears for which adequate sex and/or age class information was obtained; and 31 (14.3%) were bears known to have been killed for which sex and age information was unknown. The sample of 134 known sex and age bears consisted of 27 percent litter members (cubs, yearlings, or 2-year olds), 31 percent females greater than 3 years of age, and 42 percent males greater than 3 years of age. The sex ratio was 81 (60.4%) males to 53 (39.6%) females. The sex ratio of bears captured from 1967-76 in a tagging study (Lentfer, 1977) was significantly different. The mean age of males and females was 7.3! 4.8 years. Male mean age was 5.8 \u00b1 3.9 years and female was 9.0 \u00b1 5.4 years. A significant inverse relationship was determined for harvested female cubs less than 3 years, female subadults, 4-5 years, and females age 6-10. A significant positive relationship was determined for harvested females 10 years or older, subadult males, and adult males 6 years or older. From January 1980 to April 1982 an average annual removal of 38 females occurred. This figure excluded 31 unknown sex and age bears. If the percentage of adult females of known sex and age bears is applied to the 31 excluded bears then the average annual female removal was 44 bears. Polar bears were harvested during each month of the year except September. Of 197 bears sampled, 123 (62.4%) were harvested during November, December, and January. Forty-five bears (22.8%) were harvested in October and November, primarily in the North Slope villages. Recent harvest chronology differs markedly from that of the sports hunting era when most bears were taken from February through April. Of the 124 hunters who killed 217 polar bear during 1980-82, 37 (29.8%) killed more than one bear; of these, 27 (73.8%) killed more than 2 bears. Snowmachines (89.5%) were the most common hunting transportation form used, small boats (6.8%) ranked second and other means accounted for the remainder of the harvest."

Concentrations of Hg, Se, Cd, Pb, Se, and V generally decreased in the order of kidney>liver>muscle. Mercury, Se, and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in liver tissues in polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea (Hgx = 30.91 ug/g dw, Sex = 14.39 ug/g dw, Cdx = 1.42 ug/g dw) than the Chukchi/Bering Seas. Mercury, Se, and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in kidney tissues in polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea (Hgx = 63.95 ug/g dw, Sex = 29.1 54 ug/g dw) than the Chukchi/Bering Seas (Hgx = 23.68 ug/g dw, Sex = 15.92 ug/g dw). Based on regression analysis Hg to Se ratios in polar bear liver tissues were close to 1:1 for both Alaskan populations, which suggest that Se has a role in protecting polar bears from Hg toxicity. Mercury concentrations in liver tissues of polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea were about half of those found in the Amundsen Gulf, Canada in the eastern Beaufort Sea. Hepatic levels of copper, although very high (x = 103.05 ug/g dw), were within ranges reported from other Arctic polar bear populations. Although low, vanadium concentrations in polar bear kidneys were significantly higher in the Chukchi/Bering Seas (x = 0.871 ug/g dw) than in the Southern Beaufort Sea (x = 0.245 ug/g dw)."

Sediments, barn swallows, and their nests were analyzed for various dioxin/dibenzofuran congeners in an attempt to relate anomalies in hormone levels to those contaminants. The dioxin concentrations detected in all media at Wham Brake were elevated above those observed at the two reference sites. Generally, hormone levels in both males and females were higher in Wham Brake barn swallows relative to those observed at the reference sites. Hormone ratios (i.e., estradiol:testosterone and total estrogen:testosterone) were all comparable and, thus, were unremarkable. It is noteworthy, however, that Wham Brake total estrogen levels in both females and males and the testosterone levels in males were significantly greater than that observed at the reference sites. A comparable situation appears to exist for testosterone levels in Wham Brake females, the levels of which approached significance."

Oldsquaw (N=l8) primarily consumed amphipods (30.3% aggregate volume), gastropods (16.5%), and mysids (12.8%). The high percentage of amphipods in the diet differed from other studies at Beaufort Lagoon and elsewhere on the Beaufort Sea Coast in previous years, where mysids formed a major portion of the diet. A significantly higher number of oldsquaw in flocks (P  0.05) on oldsquaw behavior. Males molted earlier than females and most males (75%) were finished with molt when the majority of females (50%) were beginning molt (11-15 August). Males lost a significant amount of plucked body weight (wet weight), carcass weight, and breast muscle weight from premolt to early molt. A portion of that weight loss was recovered by the late molt stage. Abdominal fat deposits were utilized and not restored. Subcutaneous fat was maintained through the molt. Leg muscle weight increased through mid-molt then declined by late molt. Oldsquaw apparently catabolized small amounts of body fat and protein reserves in early molt to meet their nutritional needs in that period. The immobility of molting oldsquaw and their dependence on the lagoon food web to meet these high nutritional demands may make them highly susceptible to impacts on food sources."

                "text": "Population Ecology of Black Bears in the Okefenokee-Osceola Ecosystem The overall objective of this study was to determine population growth, sustainable yield, and factors influencing population dynamics of the species.  We studied black bears (Ursus americanus) on 2 study areas in the Okefenokee-Osceola ecosystem in north Florida and southeast Georgia from 1995-1999 to determine population characteristics (size, density, relative abundance, distribution, sex and age structure, mortality rates, natality, and recruitment) and habitat needs. We captured 205 different black bears (124M: 81F) 345 times from June 1995 to September 1998. Overall, adult bears on Osceola were 19% heavier than those on Okefenokee (t = 2.96, df = 148, P = 0.0036).We obtained 13,573 radiolocations from 87 (16M:71F) individual bears during the period of study. Seventeen mortalities of radio collared bears were documented on Okefenokee, with hunting mortality accounting for 70.6% of these deaths. We documented only 2 (8%) mortalities of radiocollared females from Osceola; both were illegally killed. Annual survival rates for radio collared females were lower on Okefenokee ( x = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80-0.93) than on Osceola ( x = 0.97, 95% CI =0.92-1.00; 2 0.05 = 3.98, 1 df, P = 0.0460). Overall, 67 bears (51M:16F) were taken by hunters on the Okefenokee study area from 1995-1999. Including the bears that were in protected areas and unavailable to harvest, the annual harvest rate was 10.1%. Our annual survival estimate for Osceola females (0.97) was among the highest reported from any southeastern bear population, no doubt influenced by the closing of the bear hunting season in and around Osceola NF in 1992. When survival estimates for Okefenokee females were recalculated without hunting mortality, overall survival rates increased from 0.87 to 0.95, similar to that of the Osceola females. To estimate population size, we maintained 88 and 94 barbed wire hair traps during 1999 on the Okefenokee and Osceola study areas, respectively. Complete multilocus genotypes were obtained for 78 (99%) of the Okefenokee samples, of which 39individual bears were identified. On the Osceola study area, complete genotypes were obtained for 84 (96%) samples representing 37 individuals. After considering a number of mark-recapture estimators, we concluded that the within-year estimate of 71 bears (95% CI = 59-91) produced by the jackknife heterogeneity model Mh was the most appropriate for the Okefenokee hair-trapping data. Likewise, we selected the estimate of 44 bears (95% CI = 40-57) on the Osceola study area provided by the null model Mo as most appropriate during 1999. The estimated densities of black bears on the Okefenokee and Osceola study areas were 0.14 and 0.12 bears/km2, respectively. Based on a weighted average density of 0.135 bears/km2 and assuming a homogeneous distribution, we estimate that approximately 830 bears (95% CI = 707-1,045) inhabit the 6,147-km2Okefenokee-Osceola ecosystem. We monitored 66 radiocollared bears (8M:58F) from 1995-1998 for 132 possible denning occasions. Denning durations for females ( x = 96.7 days, n = 109, SE = 2.7)were longer than for male bears ( x = 71.6 days, n = 9, SE = 8.8; Z = -2.38, P = 0.0174).Two male bears from Okefenokee denned in ground nests whereas tree cavities (n = 18)and ground nests (n = 16) accounted for 65% of all dens used by Okefenokee females. In contrast, ground nests accounted for 100% (n = 37) of all documented den types used by female bears on the Osceola study area. Bears on Okefenokee used shrub, blackgum, mixed shrub, and cypress habitat types on 24, 23, 21, and 13 occasions, respectively. Interestingly, 90% (n = 74) of all radiocollared bears on the Okefenokee study area denned within the boundaries of ONWR during 1995-1998. Only 1 radiocollared female from each area denned in pine habitat during this study."

The Atchafalaya River, a distributary of the Mississippi River in the Lower Mississippi River ecosystem, receives most of its volume by way of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer\u2019s Old River Control Structure. This study assessed potential biological and ecotoxicological impacts of mercury contamination on resources in the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). Forty largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were collected by electroshocking in December 1996 and October 1997. Samples were analyzed for tissue mercury levels, liver enzyme activity (EROD), DNA integrity in blood cells, reproductive hormone levels, vitellogenin (Vg) levels, percentage of white blood cells, percentage of phagocytes, macrophage aggregates (MA) and parasites in spleen tissue, and health assessments as per the Biomonitoring and Environmental Status and Trends Program. Wet weight mercury levels ranged from 0.04 to 0.52 ppm. Largemouth bass had elevated EROD activity (decontamination enzymes) in both males and females, but carp did not have elevated EROD activity in either gender. Mercury level was correlated with increased EROD (p=0.0001). Aneuploidy was demonstrated with blood from one carp, where tissue mercury levels were significantly, positively correlated with an increase in DNA coefficient of variation (CV) (p=0.0012). Spleen weights were positively correlated with increased DNA CV (p=0.0236). Vg (egg protein precursor) was found in one male carp. Splenic parasites were prevalent in two fish. Bass spleens had significantly fewer MA than carp spleens (p=0.0247), but significantly more area of tissue was involved (p=0.0003). Tissue mercury levels were significantly, negatively correlated with overall gonadosomatic index for both species (p<0.0001), and when separated by sex (male, p=0.0002 and female, p=0.0001). For carp, there was a significant negative correlation for the percent of phagocytes (p=0.0492), indicating possible immunosuppression. The study of biomarker responses of two fish species with different life histories provided a thorough assessment of an ecosystem experiencing low dissolved oxygen and anthropogenic inputs."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Samples from 56 walrus (32 males, 24 females) were collected in the villages of Diomede (n=21), Gambell (n=31), and Savoonga (n=4). Analyses for metals and metalloids were conducted on 50 kidneys and 53 livers. All samples were from adult walrus (ages 11-32 years, x=19). Analyses were completed for 23 elements; special focus was on arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc. All tissues and samples had these six elements in detectable quantities. Mean cadmium concentrations were not significantly higher than those previously reported for walrus. However, mean cadmium concentrations continue to exceed levels (13 mg/kg wet weight) thought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to interfere with organ function in some animals. A positive correlation between cadmium and age was found in both liver and kidney tissues. Similar relationships were found between age and concentrations of zinc (kidney) and arsenic (liver and kidney). Mean mercury concentrations were not significantly higher than previously reported. A close correlation between mercury and selenium was found both in the liver and kidney. Male and female tissues significantly differed in mean concentrations of arsenic (liver and kidney) and selenium (liver). It is uncertain what these results mean to the health of walrus."

A total of 112 snow geese were collected for food habits and body composition analysis. Arriving geese consumed horsetails (Eguisetum variegatum) (44.7% aggr. dry wt., n=35) and common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium) (24.1% aggr. dry wt.). Departing geese fed heavily on common cottongrass (58.8% aggr dry wt., n=30). Hand picked cottongrass stem bases contained maintenance levels of crude protein (12%), high levels of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC, 16.3%) and low levels of crude fat (1.2%). Fiber (cellulose+ lignin) made up 26.8% of the content. Estimates of true metabolizable energy for cottongrass was 7.49 kj/g. No significant differences were found in fat free dry weight (FFDW) or body measurements (wing, tarsus, bill) between geese collected during the arrival and departure phases of the staging period, indicating that little growth occurred in juveniles and little body protein was added by adults. Geese showed significant increases in body fat in both years. Adult males gained 21.5\u00b1 3.3 g fat/day (regression slope b\u00b1 SE, n=24) and females gained 22.5\u00b1 2.7 g fat/day (n=24) in 1985. In juveniles, 10.6\u00b1 2.8 (n=l7) and 11.7\u00b1 3.3 (n=ll) g fat/day were added by males and females, respectively, in 1985. Adults accumulated fat at a significantly lower rate in 1984 due to a possible reduction in food intake at the end of the longer staging period. Arriving juveniles lacked sufficient fat reserves in both years to fuel a flight to central Alberta, the migration staging area. Time budget studies showed that adults fed less in the afternoon (46.8%) than in the early morning (58.8%) or evening (59.5%) and juveniles fed less in the afternoon (67.2%) than during the remainder of the day (75.1%-75.9%). Juveniles spent significantly more time feeding (11.7\u00b1 0.8 hrs/day, P < 0.001) than adults (8.1\u00b1 0.4 hrs/day)."

The trials provide an evaluation of experimental breeding lines in alternate test sites that are environmentally similar or dissimilar to the program of origin. Data from USDA-ARS Hard Winter Wheat Regional Nurseries grown in 1987 to 2014 were used to identify similarities among Great Plains test sites. Mean correlations of entry grain yields across locations and years were used in principal factor analyses to cluster them into production zones. The procedures used were identical to those of a previously published analysis using test data from 1959 to 1989. Five factors explained 67% of the variance in the correlation matrix among Southern Regional Performance Nursery (SRPN) locations. The analysis divided the SRPN into four major Great Plains production zones, designated Southeast, Northwest, Southwest and Northeast. The remaining minor production zone consisted of only two central South Dakota locations, both outside the typical target area and selection site of SRPN entries. In the Northern Regional Performance Nursery (NRPN), five production zones were established, with location separation predominantly resulting from east\u2013west differences in performance. The SRPN and NRPN wheat production zones closely follow previously described ecological zones of adaptation of native Great Plains plant species. Wheat breeding programs and growers may continue to use the production zones established via the USDA-ARS coordinated winter wheat regional nurseries to target and select germplasm for crossing and for production."

Radio-transmitters were attached to 32 of the 50 bears and these bears were monitored through denning in October and early November. More females were captured in age classes 6.5 year old and less, while males were more abundant in 7.5 year old and older age classes. Survival of immature bears appears good from year to year based on the percentage of captured bears in each age class. No mortality was detected within the immature age classes. Preliminary data interpretation indicate that the coastal plain and foothills habitats may be used more often by younger age classes and females with young than older bear without young. Preliminary calculations of range size indicated that young bears moved over larger areas than adult bears. In all cases, range sizes determined in this study were less than recorded for brown bears in northwest Alaska and northeast Alaska. Brown bears were observed feeding on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) carcasses on 6 occasions during the study. These instances were the only recorded interactions between the 2 species, except one unsuccessful chase of a bull caribou by a bear on 23 August. Dens were located for 28 radio-collared bears and dens of 10 unmarked bears were located during aerial surveys for bear dens. Bears moved south into the foothills and mountainous habitats to den, except for 2 radio-collared bears. One brown bear denned in the coastal plain and one denned in the foothills of Marsh Creek. These 2 dens were the only bear dens located within the 1002c study area boundaries."

Radio-transmitters were attached to a total of 113 different bears during this time period and these bears were monitored through denning (October - November) each year. More males were captured in age classes 5.5 years of age or less, while females were more abundant in age classes 6.5 years old and older. No natural mortalities occurred among sample bears in 1982, however, 10 apparent mortalities occurred among 17 young bears (cubs and yearlings) in 1983. In 1984, 13 of 24 young bears were apparent mortalities, and in 1985, 18 of 40 young bears were apparent mortalities. Reasons for these high mortality rates in 1983 (58.9%), 1984 (54.2%), and 1985 (45.0%) among young bears is unknown. Four mortalities were recorded during 1985. An adult female (19.5-year old) and an adult male (20.5-year old) died over winter of exposure and drowning, repectively. Two bears ( a 13.5-year old female and a 3.5-year old male) were shot by hunters. Brown bears were observed feeding on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) carcasses (adults and calves) on 6 occasions in 1982, on 15 occasions in 1983, on 20 occasions in 1984, and on 31 occasions in 1985. Preliminary analysis of radio-relocation data indicate that brown bears appear to shift habitat use patterns to coastal areas in June and early July to coincide with occupancy of those habitats by calving and post-calving caribou. Emerged from winter dens occurred in late occurred in late April and throughout May in 1983 and 1985, but was confined to late April through mid-May in 1984, with early emergence of males and non-parturient females and later emergence of females with cubs of the year. Elevations of den sites averaged 816 \u00b1 6lm(SE) in 1983, 966 \u00b1 46m(SE) in 1984, and 964 \u00b1 64m(SE) in 1985.

The geometric mean concentration (\u00b1 SD), on a lipid weight basis (lw), of \u00d3PCBs (sum of 18 congeners) for polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea and the Chukchi/Bering Seas was 2.49 \u00b1 1.41 ug/g lw and 1.54 \u00b1 1.69 ug/g lw, respectively. Six congeners PCB-99, PCB-153, PCB-138, PCB-180, PCB-170, and PCB-194 accounted for 92% of the \u00d3PCB. The geometric mean for \u00d3CHL, \u00d3HCH, and \u00d3DDT concentrations for the Southern Beaufort Sea and Chukchi/Bering Seas populations were 0.76 \u00b1 1.95 ug/g lw vs. 0.47 \u00b1 1.77ug/g lw, 1.01 \u00b1 1.91 ug/g lw vs. 0.84 \u00b1 1.78 ug/g lw, and 0.054 \u00b1 2.12 ug/g lw vs. 0.062 \u00b1 2.24 ug/g lw, respectively. Concentrations of \u00d3PCB and \u00d3CHL were significantly greater in the Southern Beaufort Sea than in the Chukchi/Bering Seas. The percentage of oxychlordane in the \u00d3CHL (69%) and t-nonachlor (16%), the principle components of \u00d3CHL, were similar for both populations. Except for \u00d3HCH, the sum of major polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (\u00d3PCB), \u00d3CHL and \u00d3DDT concentrations were relatively low compared to other Arctic polar bear populations. \u00c2-HCH, the most persistent isomer of \u00d3HCH, accounted for 93.6% of the \u00d3HCH. \u00d3HCH increased with age and \u00d3CHL decreased with age. Adult male polar bears may not be reliable indicators of concentrations of DDE, dieldrin, and \u00d3CHL in the Arctic ecosystem. The overall low concentrations and patterns of the PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides from the Alaskan populations suggest that either contaminant levels in ringed seals are low or that polar bears may feed more frequently on prey from lower trophic levels, such as bowhead whales, Pacific walrus, and bearded seals, than polar bears from other Arctic populations. The patterns and concentrations of OCs indicate that there may be a greater influence of contaminant sources from Southeast Asia, western North America, and the North Pacific Ocean than for other polar bear populations which are more influenced by contaminant sources from North America (eastern Canada western Greenland) the European Arctic (eastern Greenland, Svalbard, Norway, and Russia)."

The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential for endocrine disrupting effects on fish collected from this watershed. The study sites were located downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant for the District of Columbia and in the Anacostia River, a tidal tributary. These sites were selected because they were located in an urbanized area, near multiple sources of endocrine disrupting compounds. The reference site was located on the tidal Patuxent River adjacent to the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary. We measured vitellogenin (Vtg) production and gonadal histopathology in field collected male common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from these sites as indicators of exposure and response to estrogenic compounds. Vtg was found at detectable levels in 100% (16 of 16) of the male carp from all sites. Vtg concentrations were all less than those measured in females, and ranged from 0.001 mg/ml (the detection limit) in the Potomac River to 0.058 mg/ml measured in an Anacostia carp. There were no statistical differences in the mean Vtg concentrations in male carp collected from the two potentially impacted sites and the reference site; however, Vtg levels in fish from all three sites appear to be above normal concentrations based on a comparison to data from several hundred carp collected in the Mississippi River Basin. The measurement of detectable levels of Vtg in all male carp collected suggests there may be widespread low level exposure of fish populations to endocrine disrupting compounds in the Potomac River. Histopathological analyses did not indicate corresponding effects on reproduction; however the sample size is limited. The finding of elevated Vtg in male carp from the reference site is somewhat surprising and may be related to exposure to agricultural chemicals, several of which are presumed endocrine disrupters. We recommend additional study including sampling a larger number of fish and the histopathological evaluation of both females and males at all sites."

The study focused on birding ecotourism because that is the primary user group that visits Malheur. A total of 481 questionnaires were completed from a total of about 39,750 annual birding ecotourists. Birders who visit Malheur tended to be middle aged (30's-40's), well educated (85.4% had attended some college), had incomes that were well above the national family average, and women and men are about equally represented. A majority did not fish or hunt. Visitors came from 28 states, 3 foreign countries, and 30 counties in Oregon.  Forty-five percent of visitors were from out of state and 88% stayed more than one day in the area. Visitors averaged 3.4 days in the area. The average amount spent on their entire trips to and from Malheur averaged about $300 and totaled $12,282,750.

In its original conception, the independent evaluator, NORC, and MCA-Honduras planned to use a randomized experimental design involving randomized assignment of communities (aldeas) to treatment. Following a series of implementation problems, the final approach used was an econometric model that relied on a model-based approach to impact evaluation. As raised in the evaluator report, one key assumption is that the causal models are correct. This is based on the assumption that all important unobserved variables affecting selection, such as proven ex-ante ability to grow horticultural crops, are time invariant (i.e., are constant between the two survey rounds).   Assumptions of the econometric model are:    1. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA, no macro effects assumption, partial equilibrium assumption) is made. This means that the effect (potential outcomes) on one individual are not affected by potential changes in the treatment exposure of other individuals. This implies, for example, that the program is not so large that the outcomes are correlated (e.g., that farmers would produce such a large amount of horticultural crops that the market would collapse).     2. The causal models are correct. The key assumption here is that all important unobserved variables affecting selection are time invariant (i.e., are constant between the two survey rounds).     3. The program intervention represents a \u201cforced change\u201d in (experimental control of) the agricultural system in Honduras.    4. The half of the country treated before this evaluation began is similar to the half yet to be treated, with respect to relationships among the important causal variables represented in the causal model underlying the statistical analysis.   The exposure period was 12-36 months.   Results from the final evaluation report include: the Model-based approach estimated net income change from horticultural crops is on average USD 600 higher for program participants than for nonparticipants. Input expenditures on these crops increased far more than they did for basic crops, implying a higher level of activity in cultivation of high value crops among program farmers. The results suggest a corresponding decline among program farmers in income from basic crops, as might be expected with changing crop mix; however, this decline is not statistically significant.    However, the program also did not appear to have had a positive effect on the proportion of farmers growing horticultural crops. This could well be because the implementer primarily chose as program participants farmers who showed a proven ability to grow horticultural crops. It is likely that increments in income from horticultural crops came from increased production among farmers already growing horticultural crops and not from farmers who switched over for the first time.  Even though there was an increase in income from horticultural crops, the evaluator did not find a corresponding statistically significant increase in net household income or household expenditures/consumption, as might have been expected."

It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

                "text": "Mozambique - Farmer Income Support Trees  For the epidemic zone, the evaluation estimated the impact of FISP on disease prevalence and estimated the consequent impact on coconut production and farmer incomes. In addition, the evaluation also assessed the pre-conditions for future increase in income by examining whether the seedlings planted through FISP survived.     To assess these impacts, because the ideal approach of randomly assigning treatment to farmers was not feasible, the evaluation employed the next best approach. It identified geographic areas that were very similar at baseline and were otherwise split into treatment and comparison areas by some external \u201cquasi-random\u201d factor (the phytosanitary barrier), and matched a subset of these areas on disease prevalence and distance to coast. This approach is sometimes called a \u201cborder discontinuity\u201d design in the applied microeconomics literature. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the phytosanitary barrier was a north-to-south imaginary line that FISP delineated, separating the areas with less than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the west side of the barrier) from the areas with more than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the east side). FISP worked on the west side of the barrier. Defined this way, the project worked in the entire epidemic zone.     However, in effect this barrier was imperfect because while it is true that generally (or on average) the disease prevalence is greater near the coast, the disease prevalence has a mosaic pattern. This means that even on the east side of the barrier, there can be areas with disease prevalence lower than 10 percent. Furthermore, the barrier was imperfectly drawn even along the perceived divide of 10 percent prevalence, as it was drawn along natural barriers such as water bodies and roads. These characteristics of the barrier and how the FISP treatment areas were defined give a unique opportunity to identify the counterfactual areas in the areas just east of the barrier. Accordingly, we used the 2008 TTI aerial photography data (TTI Production, 2009) to identify areas with similar disease prevalence as proximate as possible to either side of the barrier, with the areas on the west side serving as treatment areas, and areas on the east side serving as the comparison areas .     From among all FISP project areas on the east side of the barrier, and the non-project areas on the west side of the barrier, we identified areas where the disease prevalence was between 0 and 15 percent. These treatment and comparison areas amounted to 93 project and 65 non-project census enumeration areas (EAs) very close (within 73 kilometers) to the phytosanitary barrier that shared similar disease prevalence. Within these areas, we further refined the sample and identified approximately 24 nearest neighbor pairs of EAs matched on baseline disease prevalence and distance to coast. Our sample selection procedure, which resulted in 48 EAs, limits analysis and direct applicability to areas close to the phytosanitary barrier. The pairs were matched on:     Same district    Average baseline CLYD prevalence in 2008, in the 5-kilometer radius    Distance to coast.    No counterfactual EA was \u201cmatched\u201d with more than one treatment EA.  A small wrinkle in this identification strategy was that the FISP phytosanitary barrier was reevaluated a total of five times throughout the project, causing the barrier to shift during the course of the implementation (see Figure 2-1). To ensure that all comparison areas did not receive treatment, we have chosen comparison located east of the 2012 barrier, which is the furthest east the barrier was shifted over the course of the project.     It is important to note that in three out of the eight FISP districts there was no barrier drawn: in Pebane, Moma, and Angoche, the barrier was the coast, and FISP worked in these districts in a way that made it difficult to identify non-project areas. There was no barrier drawn in the district of Chinde, but epidemic and endemic zones (as well as project and non-project areas) were geographically separated in a way that allowed us to include the district in our sampling frame. As a result, our quantitative evaluation is focused on five out of the eight FISP districts (Nicoadala, Namacurra, Maganja da Costa, Chinde, and Inhassunge). In the remaining three districts in the Nampula district, we relied on a qualitative survey to draw lessons about the project's efficacy.    In sum, the phytosanitary barrier distinguished between epidemic FISP areas and epidemic non-FISP areas. We identified 93 FISP census EAs on the west side of the barrier and 65 non-project EAs on the east side of the phytosanitary barrier but very close (within 73 kilometers) with similar baseline disease prevalence (using the 2008 aerial photography data from TTI Production, 2009). From these, 24 pair-wised matched project and non-project areas serve as our treatment and comparison groups. Their baseline similarity, geographical similarity, and haphazard separation by the phytosanitary barrier create the ideal conditions for a quasi-experimental evaluation. This quasi-random approach identifies the impact because difference in outcomes can be attributed only to the intervention; other potentially confounding factors are similar across the phytosanitary barrier, due to geographic proximity and because of matching (Section 5.3 provides more details on the results of the matching).   Households  We designed two separate quantitative evaluations to assess the activities in the epidemic zones and the endemic zones.     Evaluation of Epidemic Zone Program: In the epidemic zones, the evaluation used a border discontinuity design. Specifically, it identified geographic areas that were very similar at baseline, except that they were split into treatment and comparison areas by an external \u201cquasi-random\u201d factor-the phytosanitary barrier. The phytosanitary barrier was a north-to-south imaginary line that FISP delineated, separating the areas with less than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the west side of the barrier) from the areas with more than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the east side). FISP did not conduct any epidemic zone activities east of this barrier. Despite the clear distinction of the barrier for implementation activities, the disease had a mosaic pattern, implying that the barrier was imperfect at delineating CLYD prevalence levels. This feature aided our evaluation, because we were able to select comparison areas to the east of the barrier that had roughly the same qualifications for selection (baseline disease prevalence) as the treatment areas. Among a subset of the census enumeration areas (EAs) on both sides of the barrier that had less than 15 percent disease prevalence, we matched EAs based on distance from coast (which also proxies for distance to barrier) and baseline disease prevalence. This strategy was feasible in five out of the eight FISP districts. In the remaining three districts in the Nampula province, where the epidemic and endemic zone programs were combined and there was no barrier separating project areas, we relied on qualitative data to assess the project.     To assess impact on outcomes related to household income coconut production and seedling survival, the unit of analysis was households. We sampled 800 households across 24 treatment and 24 comparison EAs. After accounting for nonresponse, missing observations, and outliers, we obtained a study sample of 666 usable observations. For each household we gathered information on their pre-intervention demographic characteristics and information to measure the key outcomes: seedling survival, coconut production, and income.     To assess the impact of FISP on disease prevalence, we surveyed 16,000 trees that were sampled from the same enumeration areas as the household survey in the epidemic zones. We first identified the land area within the matched EAs that had tree cover, based on the 2008 aerial photography data. Within these areas, we randomly sampled 400 grids, each 100 by 100 meters, and within each grid we drew a sample of 40 trees in four clusters. For each tree in the grid, the tree enumerators visually inspected whether the tree was healthy; had only CLYD (and not beetle infestation); had beetle infestation only; or had CLYD and beetle infestation.  The enumerators assessed beetle infestation also because CLYD is closely associated with increase in beetle infestation since dead trees - dead because of CLYD - can become a breeding ground for beetles.     To answer the question on FISP's impact on disease spread, however, we could not apply this method because that requires time series information on disease spread before, during, and after FISP. We conducted the analysis on two pairs of treatment and comparison areas for which we could find satellite data to estimate the prevalence of healthy trees between 2008 and 2014.     Evaluation of the Endemic Zone Program: In the endemic zones, which were entirely east of the phytosanitary barrier, the evaluation used a non-experimental method for selecting untreated geographic areas that, at baseline, were very similar to the treated areas. We matched pairs of treatment and comparison enumeration areas on baseline disease prevalence and distance from coast. The results of our matching and comparison of their self-reported pre-intervention characteristics suggest that the two groups are comparable and did not require any re-weighting to \u201clook similar.\u201d    In the endemic zone, we surveyed 720 households in 80 EAs across all districts. Of the 720 households surveyed, 561 observations were usable. In addition to information gathered for the epidemic zone farmers, for endemic zone farmers we also gathered information on their adoption, production, and sale of crops promoted by FISP.    Other Questions: To answer other questions, including the assessment of the BDF activity, the R&D activity, and the adaptation and adherence of FISP implementation to project goals, we conducted a desktop review of the literature. In addition, for the BDF activities and assessment of FISP's adaptation and adherence to project goals, we conducted interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions and interviews with farmers and grant recipients."

                "text": "Ghana - Agriculture - Irrigation The Millennium Development Authority (MiDA) financed the construction of a new irrigation scheme in Kpong and the renovation of two irrigation schemes in Botanga and Golinga. This data contains baseline information for the impact evaluation of this activity.  Treatment groups involve households with farmers who belong to FBOs within the geographic perimeters of the new/renovated irrigation schemes; these treatment groups are provided contracted access to an anchor farm that will enable them to receive irrigation. Comparison groups are households outside the water supply perimeters provided by the new/renovated irrigation scheme with characteristics similar to those of households in the treatment groups.   The three main research questions this evaluation will try to answer (once endline data is collected), presented in form of hypotheses to be tested, are: i) new irrigation schemes will raise production from 2 to 3 crops per year; ii) irrigation will allow for diversification of crops and potentially higher yields; and iii) irrigation will increase labor requirements. From these three hypotheses, there are five indicators that can be used to measure the impact of these irrigation activities: (1) total household income; (2) total household income from crop production; (3) paid employment per household; (4) crop mix - annual production output (kilograms) for each of the five most imported crops per household (i.e. want to observe move from low to high-value crops); and (5) crop yield (i.e. monitor output per unit, kilogram/hectare per crop cycle).  To evaluate this program, once endline data is collected, NORC proposed to use a difference-in-difference approach and an IV approach based on a distance indicator (i.e. instrument treatment with \u201cfarmer's distance from anchor farm\u201d if we can assume small farms closer to anchor farms are more likely to benefit from activity).  In terms of descriptive statistics there is no clear evidence that households in the treatment group are better or worse off than households in the comparison group at baseline. There are, however, important differences to consider. While the household head in the treatment group is more likely to be female, slightly less educated, and live in an informal dwelling, they were more likely to have children currently attending school. Households within the treatment group also had, on average, higher income, though the variance was high (as is the case with income in general), and the difference was not statistically significant. With respect to farming activities, there are two important differences to highlight across experimental groups. First, households in comparison groups were more likely to own their own plots. This is important because the impact of irrigation activities could be confounded if the households in the treatment group are less likely to make long-term investments than households in the comparison group. Second, households in the treatment group owned smaller plots of land in terms of area, on average."

Moller's (1951) method for estimating rainfall frequencies was adopted to provide ocean precipitation data. Monthly percentage frequencies were extracted from the mapped isolines of the US Marine Climatic Atlas (US Naval Weather Service 1955-1965) and interpolated to the grid points.

The program had no impact on girls\u2019 math scores, though there is suggestive evidence it may have had a positive impact of 0.09 standard deviations on girls\u2019 French test scores. No significant impacts were detected for boys\u2019 enrollment, attendance, or test scores. Finally, impacts were larger for younger children (ages 7-10), than for those between the ages of 10 and 12.  After four years (using data collected in 2013 during the NECS Wave 1 data collection), the Niger IMAGINE Long-Term Evaluation found that IMAGINE had a 8.3 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a  7.9 percentage point negative impact on absenteeism.  On average, children in treatment villages scored 0.13 standard deviations higher on the math assessment than children in control villages (significant at the 5 percent level). Test scores in French for children in treatment villages were higher than in control villages, but were not statistically significant. The evaluation found  large and significant impacts of the program on enrollment, attendance, and math scores for females,    compared to more modest and less significant impacts for males."

The MULT package defines multiplier arrays for calculation of model-layer characteristics from parameter values. The Central Valley encompasses an approximate 50,000 square-kilometer region of California. The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the USGS numerical modeling code, MODFLOW-FMP (Schmid and others, 2006). This simulation is referred to here as the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) (Faunt, 2009). Utilizing MODFLOW-FMP, the CVHM simulates groundwater and surface-water flow, irrigated agriculture, land subsidence, and other key processes in the Central Valley on a monthly basis from 1961-2003. The total active modeled area is 20,334 square-miles on a finite-difference grid comprising 441 rows and 98 columns. Slightly less than 50 percent of the cells are active. It has a uniform horizontal discretization of 1x1 square mile and is oriented parallel to the valley axis, 34 degrees west of north (Faunt, 2009). The MULT Package includes the percentage of coarse-grained deposits in each of the 10 model layers, specific yield, and the altitudes of the tops of model layers 1-4. In order to better characterize the aquifer-system deposits, lithologic data from approximately 8,500 drillers' logs of boreholes ranging in depth from 12 to 3,000 feet below land surface were compiled and analyzed. The percentage of coarse-grained sediment, or texture, then was computed for each 50-foot depth interval of the drillers' logs. A 3-dimensional texture model was developed by interpolating the percentage of coarse-grained deposits onto a 1-mile spatial grid at 50-foot depth intervals from land surface to 2,800 feet below land surface. The specific yield data were extrapolated from the percentage of coarse-grained deposits in model layer 1. The CVHM is the most recent regional-scale model of the Central Valley developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The CVHM was developed as part of the USGS Groundwater Resources Program (see \"Foreword\", Chapter A, page iii, for details)."

The values stored in this product are the percentage of radiometer and scatterometer measurements identified as corrupted by interference by the RFI detection algorithms [1,2] within each data point, averaged over one month. An additional RFI flag [3] is used to identify locations where the measured brightness temperature over land exceeds the expected limits of surface emissivity. This flag is not used to remove samples from further processing, but, in generating the radiometer RFI data, 100% RFI is assigned to points where this flag is raised.   This product can be used to reproduce the RFI maps available on the Aquarius website at University of Maine (https://aquarius.umaine.edu/cgi/gal_radiometer.htm for the radiometer, and https://aquarius.umaine.edu/cgi/gal_scatterometer.htm for the scatterometer), by plotting the variables Rad_RFI_percent_AscDes_AllBeams and Scat_RFI_percent_AscDes_AllBeams on the latitude/longitude grid. Additionally, the user can generate maps by using only a particular beam or only  ascending passes, for example. All combinations of beams and ascending/descending passes are possible.  This product contains information about RFI, but it is also relevant for the retrieved Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Over the ocean, the RFI percentage in this product corresponds to the amount of raw measurements  discarded due to RFI contamination before SSS retrieval. Therefore, maps of the RFI percentage can give the user an indication of where RFI is more likely to have affected the quality of SSS retrievals, for a particular month, or for a series of months."

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

EEDSM beneficiaries include the entire population with access to electricity, an estimated 4.3 million households with 19.6 million people. The EEDSM Project consists of four activities: the Development and Enforcement of Standards and Labels activity, the Improved Energy Auditing activity, the Education and Public Information activity, and the Demand Side Management activity.   The evaluation of the EEDSM project will address the following questions for each of the four interventions designed to reduce energy waste and increase the reserve margin between electricity supply and peak demand. These interventions include (1) a rollout of energy efficiency standards, (2) implementation of the pre-tertiary school curriculum and public information on use of efficient appliances with standards and labels via different media platforms, (3) implementation of an energy auditing and retrofitting activity and an intervention to establish two sustainable energy services centers (SESCs) that will train and certify energy auditors for the country, and (4) installing energy-efficient LED street lights. The methodological approach for the performance evaluation of EEDSM relies in tracking key outcomes over time, qualitative data analysis, pre-post analysis, and simulations. The impact evaluation will assess the impact of the R2R&R intervention on the electricity consumption. We will measure impacts relative to the pre-treatment period using an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) method which involves comparing outcomes before an intervention is implemented with those after. The sample for the analysis of outcomes from administrative utility data will include the intervention buildings.   Evaluation questions include: 1. Have the EEDSM interventions changed consumption of electricity by individual customers? 2. Did the availability and purchases of more energy-efficient appliances increase when standards were implemented? To what extent can these changes be attributed to the new standards? 3. To what extent has the R2R&R intervention affected electricity use and bill payment rates? 4. Were project activities implemented as designed? How did implementation (in terms of objectives, activities, and beneficiaries) deviate from the original logic driving the investment, and why? How did changes in implementation affect project performance? What were the implementation successes and challenges? 5. Were improvements in project outcomes sustained after the end of the compact? What sustainability planning was done during implementation, and why? What are the critical institutional factors that affected their sustainability?"

                "text": "Data from: Defensive aphid symbiont Hamiltonella defensa effects on Aphelinus glycinis and Aphelinus atriplicis Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa /APSE by two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.    Insect sources and rearing conditions    Aphelinus glycinis was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect Aphis craccivora or Acyrthosiphon pisum because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.    Aphis craccivora is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Acyrthosiphon pisum is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Aphis craccivora in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and Ac. pisum were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, Vicia faba L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in H. defensa in Ac. pisum and APSE type 4 was found in H. defensa in Ap. craccivora. Aphid lines without H. defensa were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on V. fava plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of H. defensa from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from Ap. craccivora and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from Ac. craccivora were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of H. defensa and APSE prior to assays.    Aphelinus atriplicis was collected as mummified Diuraphis noxia on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; A. glycinis was collected as mummified Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. Aphelinus glycinis was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); A. atriplicis was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the Aphelinus varipes complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. Aphelinus atriplicis was reared on D. noxia on barley, Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae); Aphelinus glycinis was reared on Aphis glycines on soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of A. glycines was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither D. noxia nor A. glycines are known to harbor H. defensa, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of H. defensa in our colonies of these species. Although A. glycines harbors another bacterium, Arsenophonus, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.    Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with Hamiltonella defensa versus uninfected aphids    To measure the effect of infection with H. defensa harboring APSE on parasitism of Ap. craccivora and Ac. craccivora, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of Aphelinus atriplicis or Aphelinus glycinis that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with H. defensa or uninfected aphids on V. faba variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. Aphelinus females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.    The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.    Aphids parasitized by these Aphelinus species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.    Design structure    The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for Aphelinus glycinis on Ap. craccivora and Aphelinus atriplicis on Ap. craccivora and on Ac. pisum (24 each for Hamiltonella-infected versus uninfected aphids)."

This trail project presented a good opportunity to involve many people in habitat restoration of an area that will, once developed, be highly visible to many people. It also offers a way to involve young and old volunteers who may not be physically able to do the heavy lifting associated with trail development and presents a unique educational opportunity to discuss invasive terrestrial and aquatic plants and their impacts on refuge ecosystems with visiting students. Friends of LPO Educational Trail proposal bisects an area of approximately 50 acres and includes 1.2 linear miles of existing dirt road, a user-developed trail, and undisturbed dry forest habitat. Volunteers pulled and dug weeds, clipped seedheads and released biological control agents. They focused on removing knapweeds, hawkweed, and St. Johnswort growing adjacent to the developing trail. This effort will ultimately enhance future visitors experience and assist refuge staff with weed eradication."

Contaminant concentrations, reproductive success, and biomagnification factors (BMFs) were determined and effects of residue levels were measured by H4IIE rat hepatoma and ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) bioassays. Fledging and reproductive rates were similar to those determined for other healthy heron populations. With the exception of one site, mean residue concentrations in heron eggs and prey were low. However, elevated concentrations of PCBs were detected in eggs and prey from Ross Island on the Willamette River. Among-site differences were not statistically significant different in H4IIE TCDD-equivalents (TCDD-EQs) or EROD activity, although the TCDD-EQ for Karlson Island was 9 to 20 times greater than that of any other site. Large differences existed between toxic equivalents calculated from egg residue concentrations and TCDDEQs, which indicated non-additive interactions among the compounds. TCDD-EQs and nest failure were positively correlated with TCDD concentration. Biomagnification factors varied greatly among sites for most compounds. Of the organochlorine pesticides, DDE and heptachlor epoxide were magnified the most. Penta- and hexachlorinated dioxins were biomagnified to a greater extent than TCDD. Our results support the use of great blue herons as an indicator of contamination in aquatic ecosystems. Their relatively low sensitivity to organochlorine contaminants and high trophic position allows contaminant accumulation and biomagnification without immediate adverse effects which are often seen in other, more sensitive species. Breeding behavior of great blue herons was also examined at the six colonies to Patterns of brooding, pair bonding, preening, and nest visits were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the reference and non-reference sites. The site with the highest concentrations of DDE and PCBs had significantly lower nest attendance and feeding rates relative to the reference site. Differences in nest attendance among colonies were inversely correlated with DDE concentrations (r = -0.79, P = 0.06). Among-site differences in the odds ratios for adults feeding chicks were positively correlated with DDE and PCB concentrations (r = 0.84, P = 0.04 and r = 0.79, P = 0.06 respectively), but these relationships may be an artifact of the low frequency of occurrence of feeding sessions and its dependence on nest attendance. Clutch size and hatch, fledge, and reproductive success were similar to those reported for healthy populations. Differences in activity budgets among sites do not appear to be affecting reproductive rates of herons at the different colonies."

The Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) grouped all eligible schools within the five study departments into school districts-clusters of neighboring schools with eight schools each, on average. We randomly assigned 80 percent of those districts to a treatment group, in which schools would be invited to participate in Activity 1. We assigned the remaining 20 percent of districts to a control group, in which the implementer would not intervene.   We will gather baseline and endline data from a randomly selected sample of schools from the treatment and control groups. We will estimate Activity 1's causal effects by comparing outcomes from the two groups at endline and controlling for chance differences observed at baseline. We will report two types of estimates: intent-to-treat estimates, which reflect differences between treatment and control schools regardless of their participation in treatment, and local average treatment effects, which are adjusted to account for participation rates in both groups. We describe our sample selection, randomization, and data collection methods elsewhere in sampling and data collection methods sections.   We will describe the implementation of the activity and identify its facilitators and barriers via an implementation study. We describe our sample selection and data collection methods in the sampling and data collection methods sections.  Activity 3:  We will conduct a trend analysis to understand changes in key outcomes related to this activity. This approach will not show the activity's causal impacts, but we will combine the trend analysis with an analysis of related concurrent events to see the potential relationship between the activity and outcomes of interest.   We will also conduct a qualitative analysis, relying on focus groups, interviews, and implementation documentation. We will use the drivers-of-change (DOC) framework and political economy methods to structure the qualitative component. The DOC framework is an analytic framework for applying political economy analysis, which enables evaluators to systematically assess how project design and implementation decisions addressed contextual factors that may affect whether project goals are met. Specifically, the DOC framework calls for an analysis of the relationship between structural features (such as the structure and history of education in Guatemala and social and demographic trends), institutions (such as the legal framework, government policies, and informal rules that affect behavior), and agents (such as organizations and people who influence and participate in lower-secondary education).  Note:     Under Evaluation Methodology, we selected Randomization, which is the method for the impact evaluation of Activity 1. We will also conduct implementation evaluations of Activities 1 and 3 and political economy analyses of Activity 3.  Under data type, we selected Sample Survey Data, which is the main method for the impact evaluation of Activity 1. For both activities, we will also use administrative data, monitoring and evaluation data from the implementer, and qualitative data."

After one year (using the data collected in 2011) the Impact Evaluation of Niger's IMAGINE program found that IMAGINE had a 4.3 percentage point positive impact on primary school enrollment, no impact on attendance, and no impact on math and French test scores. The program impacts were generally larger for girls than for boys. For girls, the program had an 8 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a 5.4 percentage point impact on attendance. The program had no impact on girls\u2019 math scores, though there is suggestive evidence it may have had a positive impact of 0.09 standard deviations on girls\u2019 French test scores. No significant impacts were detected for boys\u2019 enrollment, attendance, or test scores. Finally, impacts were larger for younger children (ages 7-10), than for those between the ages of 10 and 12.  After four years (using data collected in 2013 during the NECS Wave 1 data collection), the Niger IMAGINE Long-Term Evaluation found that IMAGINE had a 8.3 percentage point positive impact on enrollment and a  7.9 percentage point negative impact on absenteeism.  On average, children in treatment villages scored 0.13 standard deviations higher on the math assessment than children in control villages (significant at the 5 percent level). Test scores in French for children in treatment villages were higher than in control villages, but were not statistically significant.

Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

                "text": "Virtual wells used for pumpage for the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) Abstract: This digital dataset contains the virtual wells used for pumpage for the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM). The Central Valley encompasses an approximate 50,000 square-kilometer region of California. The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) numerical modeling code MODFLOW-FMP (Schmid and others, 2006). This simulation is referred to here as the CVHM (Faunt, 2009). Utilizing MODFLOW-FMP, the CVHM simulates groundwater and surface-water flow, irrigated agriculture, land subsidence, and other key processes in the Central Valley on a monthly basis from 1961-2003. The total active modeled area is 20,334 square-miles on a finite difference grid comprising 441 rows and 98 columns. Slightly less than 50 percent of the cells are active. The CVHM model grid has a uniform horizontal discretization of 1x1 square mile and is oriented parallel to the valley axis, 34 degrees west of north (Faunt, 2009). Groundwater pumpage is a major part of the groundwater budget of the Central Valley, and is grouped into two categories for this study: agricultural and urban (which includes municipal and industrial sources). Discharge from agricultural wells rarely is metered in the Central Valley (Diamond and Williamson, 1983), and therefore must be estimated by indirect means. If consumptive use can be quantified, groundwater pumpage may be estimated by taking into account surface-water supply, irrigation efficiency, and effective precipitation. Irrigation efficiency, as used in this report, is the percentage of water delivered to the Water Balance Subregion (WBS) that is available for consumptive use. The newly developed MODFLOW-FMP uses this method (Schmid and others, 2006). Wells were simulated as a combination of farm wells (Schmid and others, 2006) and multi-node wells (Halford and Hanson, 2002) (Faunt, 2009; fig. C3). Farm wells are simulated in a manner similar to the WEL package (Harbaugh and others, 2000) and the pumpage is distributed among each of the farm wells (Schmid and others, 2006). Agricultural pumpage is estimated through the FMP. A single well that represents the composite of all wells within a model cell is referred to here as a virtual well. For the FMP, in each WBS, a virtual well was placed in each model cell where an irrigated crop was the predominant land use for a given time frame. Because the extent of irrigated agriculture changes through time, wells were added and deleted accordingly in the model during the simulation period. In general, wells were added through time because the extent of irrigated agriculture generally increases through time. In some areas, however, agricultural wells were replaced by urban wells in the model as the land use changed from agricultural to urban. The CVHM is the most recent regional-scale model of the Central Valley developed by the USGS.The CVHM was developed as part of the USGS Groundwater Resources Program (see \"Foreword\", Chapter A, page iii, for details)."

Attention: These data are not appropriate for estimates of percentage cover. NPP-associated percent cover measurements were developed for and are used solely to provide the best estimate of biomass production. Becuase the methodology results in measurements of overlapping subcanopy systems and canopies of adjacent individuals, NPP percent cover measurements are not an appropriate measure of actual aerial plant cover. Doing so will result in inflated numbers for the \"actual\" vegetative cover. Attention: Data through 2003 was replaced online per below on 9/22/2011. Analyses and results for ANPP differ from previous uses of the data from 1989-1998 (Huenneke et al., 2002) in three ways: (1) Yucca elata was removed prior to analysis because its growth form results in large errors in biomass estimates from year-to-year, (2) regressions between biomass and plant volume used an intercept equal to 0 to be consistent with a recent study in a similar system (Muldavin et al., 2008), and (3) reference harvests obtained in extreme years resulted in adjusted regression coefficents through time that reflect year-to-year variation in ANPP. These changes result in ANPP values that are smaller compared (Peters et al. submitted) with previous studies (Huenneke et al., 2002)."

The purpose of this report is to summarize the data from these collections, evaluate status of these two refuges with respect to the contaminants analyzed, and suggest how this baseline information can be used to establish criteria for a long-term management program. Organochlorine (OC) compounds were detected at both Sequoyah and Little River, magnitude of contamination at the two locations differed greatly. At Little River, no OCs were detected in sediment. DDE, which was virtually the only OC found in Little River fish, occurred at low concentrations (0.02-0.88 mg/kg dry weight). Comparison of DDE concentrations from Little River with suggested guidelines for the protection of fish-eating predators, indicate risk to the latter. The ratio of DDE to total DDT homologs in fish was 1.0, thus, the source of contamination to the watershed was assumed to be old and well weathered. Conditions at River do not appear to warrant further action with respect to OCs. At Sequoyah, there was evidence for a greater severity of OC contamination. DDE found in 41% of the sediment samples. Fish contained several OC compounds; and some species (largemouth bass, white bass and channel catfish3 often exceeded the suggested predator protection guidelines of 4.0 mg/kg (dry weight) total DDT or 0.4 mg/kg total chlordane, heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin. The geometric mean ratio of DDE to total DDT was 0.84, suggesting a less weathered or more recent source of parent material. Since the use of OC products has been banned in the United States, the management objective at Sequoyah should be a steady reduction in concentrations and an increase in DDE/total DDT ratios in the aquatic food-chain. A monitoring program to verify the desired trend is outlined. No \"problem\" trace element contamination was evident at either Sequoyah or Little River, however some form of anthropogenic trace element enrichment is always possible at either location in the future. The management objective at each refuge should be to maintain present base concentrations, particularly with respect to those elements known to be potentially toxic (i.e. arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium and zinc). Therefore, a monitoring program for detection of element contamination is described and recommended for both refuges."

The USFWS Ecological Services Office, Fairbanks, requested Migratory Bird Management (MBM), Anchorage, to update the status and trend of Spectacled Eiders based on our recent aerial and ground-based population monitoring data. This report presents background information, a summary of the approach used, and some details of the analysis used in this review process. We have included all data collected by the North Slope early-June survey (Larned et al. 2005, Larned et al. 2006, in prep), the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) coastal aerial survey (Platte et al. 2005, Platte et al.2006, in prep), and ground plots searched for nests on the central coast of the YKD (Fischer et al. 2006). We present new analysis linking the aerial and ground observations on the YKD. Based on an untested assumption that the same relationship holds for other aerial surveys flown during June on the North Slope of Alaska and the Northeastern Arctic coast of Russia, we expand our consideration to the world population of Spectacled Eiders. Using a simple projection matrix with seasonally partitioned mortality rate components, we modeled the nesting population to derive an approximate estimate of total population size in June and October from the three geographic areas."

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project.   GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress WST.  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently.   GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.   This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size.   A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.   The GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the \"final\" GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.  There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 2c, Combined data, \"Set1\"   The \"individual\" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:          GSSTF_Fxx_2c, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)    The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_2c collection.

This southeast Alaskan island is home to a large seabird colony and is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. We sampled additional storm-petrel eggs in 2007, evaluating a suite of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and methylmercury (MeHg) to further define contaminants exposure in these seabirds. Our results show that storm-petrels on St. Lazaria Island accumulated some organic compounds and methylmercury and transferred these contaminants to their eggs. Egg contaminant residues represent the contaminants present in the bird\u2019s breeding territory mesopelagic diet (Hobson et al. 1997). Flame-retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been reported in numerous Arctic species and in other seabirds (She et al., 2004) but were not detected in this study at or above the analytical detection limits (0.00676 to 0.0201 ppm wet weight.). Metals concentrations in our sampled eggs were not at levels that have been associated with lowered reproduction or other detrimental effects on birds (Eisler 1985a, 1985b, 1987, 1988, 1998; Heinz 1979; Whitworth et al. 1991). The highest total PCB concentration in the 2007 samples was 5.01 ppm wet weight with a mean of 1.33 ppm wet weight. In general, total PCB concentrations were greater in the 2007 samples than our previous years\u2019 samples and were similar to PCB concentrations reported in other Alaska seabird studies (Vander Pol et al. 2004; Vander Pol et al. 2009). Those investigations\u2019 PCB levels were generally lower than those reported in other literature. Methylmercury results from St. Lazaria eggs exceeded avian toxicity thresholds for this contaminant. However, comparison with mercury data from other seabird species\u2019 eggs indicates that St. Lazaria storm-petrel eggs have comparable methylmercury concentrations (Braune et al. 2001, Goodale 2008). Our results were also very similar to results from Leach\u2019s storm-petrel eggs in two Maine studies (Goodale et al. 2008, 2009). Based on the small number of samples collected to date, contaminants in storm-petrel eggs from St. Lazaria Island are at relatively low concentrations and do not represent a risk to this population. However, extrapolation from such a small sample size is difficult, particularly given the high variability within some of the existing samples. These results represent input of contaminants to the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem through atmospheric and oceanic transport from distant sources and serve as initial baseline for this species in Southeast Alaska. Although concentrations are primarily below toxic thresholds, our egg residues are greater for PCBs and some organochlorine compounds than data reported in storm-petrel eggs in the past decade from the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia (Elliott and Noble 1993; Elliott et al. 1997) and from Eastern Canada in 1984 (Pearce et al. 1989). Future sampling of storm-petrels on St. Lazaria is recommended to examine long-term contaminant trends in these species, as pollution sources may change with time and the effects of climate change on contaminant exposure are unknown. Additional sampling of other storm-petrel colonies would be useful to determine if there is a geographical difference in contaminant loads. These data can be used to track contaminant trends in these species within the refuge. Spatial differences in colony contaminant concentrations may suggest different pollution sources pathways of contaminant transport."

                "text": "Forest Bird Demographic Monitoring: Hakalau National Wildlife Refuge Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Hakalau) is a critical stronghold for 3 endangered, 1 ESA candidate species, and 4 other endemic Hawaiian forest birds. Longterm trends of native forest bird populations at Hakalau have been steady or increasing (Camp et al. 2010), but forest birds across the island of Hawai\u2019i are overall trending downward (Gorresen et al. 2009) and recent (1999-2012) population trends for several species at Hakalau also indicate a downward trend (Camp et al. in press). Population dynamics and trends are driven by a population\u2019s vital rates: survival, reproduction, and movement (immigration and emigration). Factors that influence the vital rates of birds include their environment (both biotic and abiotic), availability of habitat and other resources, scales of movement, and exposure to disease. Only by monitoring a population\u2019s vital rates can we understand factors influencing trends and have the ability to detect changes in populations that may require management intervention. To date, we have conducted 4 years of banding and 3 years of nest monitoring\u037e we have been very successful in capturing and recapturing birds, resighting marked birds, collecting data on bird condition and health, locating nests, monitoring productivity and tracking movements. However, 5 years is the typical length needed for such studies to obtain highquality data from which robust vital rate estimates can be derived.The objectives of the proposed study are to directly measure vital rates (survivorship and productivity) and condition of native Hawaiian forest birds at Hakalau through banding mark/recapture efforts and nest searching and monitoring, with an emphasis on identifying factors influencing such vital rates (e.g., elevation, habitat structure, disease, management activities). Second, evaluate whether the vital rates are at sufficient levels to ensure native bird population\u2019s longterm viability. Historical estimates of vital rates from all Hakalau forest bird species in the 1990\u2019s have been used to create demographic models (manuscript in journal review) which help us understand and identify factors driving population trends. Current data will be plugged into these demographic models to assess viability of species at present.Banding and nest searching/monitoring will be conducted at the 3 established study sites in Hakalau. Field work will be conducted from February-May (4 months), which is peak breeding period for the majority of forest birds. Upon the completion of this last season of demographic research at Hakalau, we will begin analysis of the markrecapture data to derive estimates of survival and recruitment, and estimates of site fidelity and movement. Nest monitoring data will be analyzed to develop baseline productivity estimates for each species (currently lacking) and evaluate various factors (e.g., habitat, elevation) that might be affecting productivity.If survival and reproductive rates are found to be lower than sustainable for a species, further investigations could be initiated to determine what factors (e.g., interspecific competition, disease, parasites, predation, or habitat quality) are responsible.  Managers can use this information to implement actions to mitigate threats and assess the effectiveness of such management actions on vital rates to develop an adaptive management approach."

NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.  This dataset consists of a suite of historical trends in terrestrial hydrology over the conterminous United States estimated for the water years of 1980-2015 using the NCA-LDAS daily reanalysis. NCA-LDAS provides gridded daily outputs from the uncoupled Noah version 3.3 land surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution forced with NLDAS-2 meteorology (Xia et al., 2012), rescaled Climate Prediction Center precipitation, and assimilated satellite-based soil moisture, snow depth, and irrigation products (Jasinski et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019).  Trends in annual hydrologic indicators are reported using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test at p < 0.1 significance. An additional precipitation trend field (annual total), with no significance test applied, is included for comparison purposes. Collectively, these fields represent the bulk of the results presented in Jasinski et al. (2019)."

                "text": "Earth System Research Laboratory Long-Term Surface Aerosol Measurements Aerosol measurements began at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Global Monitoring Division (GMD) baseline observatories in the mid-1970's with the purpose of detecting a response, or lack of response, of atmospheric aerosols to changing conditions on a global scale. In 1992 ESRL/GMD expanded its aerosol research program to include regional aerosol monitoring stations due to anthropogenic aerosols creating a significant perturbation in the Earth's radiative balance on regional scales. The goals of this regional-scale monitoring program are to characterize means, variability, and trends of climate-forcing properties of different types of aerosols, and the factors that control them. In situ measurements of aerosol optical properties (including light absorption, total scattering, hemispheric backscattering, and total aerosol number concentration) are made at monitoring sites at hourly time resolution. The basic aerosol measurement system consists of a nephelometer (measures aerosol light scattering), absorption photometer (measures light absorption), and a condensation nuclei counter (measures particle number concentration). Data from the aerosol monitoring stations are updated several times a day. Following collection of the raw data at the station, the data are inspected through automatic and manual contamination screenings to eliminate contamination from local pollution sources. Automatic screenings use measured wind speed, direction, and/or total particle number concentration to flag contaminated data. Manual screening is more subjective, relying on the station scientist to evaluate the data in the context of automated contamination flags and their knowledge of the site.  Data applications indicate the importance of continuing to provide long-term aerosol in-situ measurements for use in analysis of trends and climatologies, evaluation of model simulations of aerosol climatologies, and behavior and validation of remote sensing retrievals of aerosol optical properties. GMD's measurements also provide ground-truth for satellite measurements and global models, as well as key aerosol parameters for global-scale models.   Through the Big Earth Data Initiative (BEDI), ESRL/GMD has taken their data collection and converted files into NetCDF-4, a self-describing format."

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 5 and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5 wanted reliable estimates on the status and trends of wetlands in five states: Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia. and West Virginia, and developed a joint study to accomplish this objective. This study was designed to identify the status and trends of wetlands in the five states from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. It represents the first regional intensification of the national wetland trends study. The study also aimed to generate reliable estimates of wetland status and trends in the 64,000-square mile Chesapeake Bay watershed. This technical report presents significant study findings for the five-state region, each state, and the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The study involved three basic steps: (1) study design, (2) data collection, and (3) data analysis compilation. Each step is discussed in the following subsections. The type and extent of wetlands within each sample lot were determined through aerial photo interpretation techniques. Aerial photographs from the mid-1950s and late 1970s/early 1980s were obtained for each new plot. The approximate study interval was 23 years. Once samples were photointerpreted and digitized, computer tapes with the results were sent to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Ecology Center (formerly the Western Energy and Land Use Team) in Ft. Collins, Colorado. The results were analyzed on the Colorado State University computer using the same program used to analyze the national wetland trends study."

Tracks were observed along all of the transects flown. As expected, wolf activity was most concentrated in drainages, i.e. along the Yukon and Nowitna rivers and their tributaries. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn from the number of wolves seen, it is highly unlikely that this type of survey would result in nearly 20% of the total wolf population being observed. This lends further credence to our belief that the wolf numbers derived are minimum estimates. Known harvest levels for wolves have been relatively low in recent years (3 in 1985, 3 in 1986), although refuge trappers have reported an increase in wolf numbers. Land and shoot wolf tapping activity has apparently increased on the refuge in 1987, and at least 12 wolves have been harvested this spring. An accurate determination of the Nowitna NWR wolf population has become necessary in light of the recent decline in the area's moose population."

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project.   GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress WST.  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently.   GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.    This is the Monthly product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. The monthly product is a result of averaging of a month worth of daily GSSTF2c files. Starting with Version 2c, there is only one set of Combined data, \"Set1\".  A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.    The monthly temporal and one-degree spatial resolution of the product can be used to examining climate variability at these scales. Oceanic evaporation contributes to the net fresh water input to the oceans and drives the upper ocean density structure and consequently the circulation of the oceans.   The short name for this product is GSSTFM."

The 2016 REI Report builds on work from a 2001 REI study. In 2001, to encourage the development of an economic market for recycling, EPA supported the creation of a national Recycling Economic Information (REI) Project and the related REI report, based upon the work of several states and regions. The REI report was a ground breaking national study demonstrating the economic value of recycling and reuse to the U.S. economy. Compiled through a cooperative agreement with the National Recycling Coalition, the study confirmed what many have known for decades: there are significant economic benefits in recycling.  The 2016 report focuses on the economic impacts of recycling rather than the environmental benefits, as the environmental benefits have been researched in detail. Accurately estimating the impact that recycling has on jobs, wages and taxes is important because the results can influence policy decisions and provide a more robust picture of recycling by adding an economic layer on top of the more heavily researched environmental impacts of recycling. For more information, please visit https://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report.  The REI Report is part of EPA's larger SMM program (https://www.epa.gov/smm). Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire lifecycles. It represents a change in how our society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection. By looking at a product's entire lifecycle we can find new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources and reduce costs. There are multiple challenge programs available as part of the SMM program, including the Food Recovery Challenge, the Electronics Challenge, the Federal Green Challenge and the WasteWise program."

(2) How was the activity implemented? (3) Did the activity produce its desired results, and what is the extent of the relevant evidence? (4) What was learned about supporting enterprise development and how sustainable are MCC's efforts in this area? and (5) What are the lessons for MCC and other stakeholders from the design and implementation of this activity?    This analysis relies on a mixed-methods approach, in which Mathematica staff collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data from a variety of sources, including administrative records, programmatic reports, and stakeholder interviews. In July 2012, Mathematica staff conducted interviews with MCC, FOMILENIO, Chemonics, and technical service provider staff, as well as members of FOMILENIO's board of directors, an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, representatives from S\u00faper Selectos (a major grocery store chain in El Salvador), PBS participants, and representatives from FOMILENIO-supported enterprises. To formulate primary findings and conclusions, Mathematica staff triangulated qualitative information provided by all interviewed stakeholders and analyzed this information in conjunction with administrative reports and records.  Interim Impact Evaluation:    The Productive Development Project (PDP) was one of three large-scale projects financed under the 2006 compact between the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of El Salvador. The main objective of the PDP was to assist in the development of profitable and sustainable business ventures for poor individuals in El Salvador's Northern Zone. Between 2008 and 2012, the PDP used nearly $72 million in allocated funds to serve over 13,500 participants and create more than 11,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The PDP comprised three activities: Production and Business Services (PBS), Investment Support, and Financial Services. The PBS Activity -- the subject of this impact evaluation and the largest of the three activities -- provided technical and material assistance to farmers and small-scale producers to support the Northern Zone's dairy, fruit, horticulture, handicrafts, tourism, forestry, and coffee sectors.  The design for the impact evaluation of the PBS Activity is a randomized rollout design, in which some producers were offered PBS assistance several months before other producers were offered similar assistance. The goal of this design is to attain the highest level of rigor possible without significantly altering existing implementation plans. The evaluation is limited to three value chains: (1) handicrafts, (2) dairy, and (3) horticulture. Among all value chains in the PBS, these three chains were most amenable to random assignment, and were expected to yield impacts in the one-year interim timeline specified for the evaluation.   Treatment groups were offered PBS assistance in the first implementation phase (beginning in late 2009 for handicrafts and mid-2010 in the case of the dairy and horticulture chains) and control groups in the dairy and horticulture chains were offered PBS assistance roughly one year after the treatment group. As over 15,000 individuals had participated in the PBS Activity by August 2012, this evaluation sample of 1,736 individuals (518, 593, and 625 in the dairy, horticulture, and handicrafts chains, respectively) includes only 11 percent of the individuals served under the activity."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

The survey was implemented in six regions including the North Atlantic, MidAtlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, West Coast, and Alaska. This report, Volume I, presents the survey results at the national scale only. The survey was developed through a collaborative process that underwent extensive reviews by NOAA Fisheries\u2019 economists, NOAA Fisheries\u2019 regional recreational coordinators and by key recreational fishing stakeholder groups. The survey was also tested with four focus groups. Following these reviews and testing, the survey was approved for an information collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Surveys were administered using a mail survey and followed the Modified Dillman Method (Dillman 2007). Overall, a total of 33,673 anglers were recruited for the survey; just over 27% (9,200) returned a completed survey. Response rates were highest in the North Atlantic region (38.3%) and lowest in the Gulf of Mexico (21.1%). On average, respondents have participated in recreational saltwater fishing for 28 years, and fished 25 days during the last year. The majority of the respondents fish from a private boat within three miles of shore; however, most trips were taken from a shore mode, including beaches, piers or bridges. The vast majority of respondents stated that they would not decrease their number of fishing trips in the following year. For the majority of those who would reduce their trips, it would be for financial reasons. Anglers responding to the survey usually used friends and family as sources of information about fishing. Spending time with family friends is an important part of a fishing trip, but catching fish and fishing in uncongested areas are also important to anglers. Anglers who anticipated they would fish less in the coming year did not primarily identify fishing regulations as the cause, but rather most frequently cited financial considerations and lack of leisure time as the likely causes of decreased fishing trips. Broadly, anglers think that the most important recreational fisheries management objectives should be: providing high quality fishing opportunities for future generations, providing different types of fish, and providing large quantities of fish. Anglers also want federal and state agencies to have consistent and simple regulations. While providing substantial numbers of fish to catch and providing species diversity were rated as important for most anglers, only about half of the respondents were satisfied with how recreational fisheries management addresses these issues. The most important management strategies that recreational fisheries should focus upon are: providing enough fish for recreational fishermen, incorporating stakeholder interests in the policy process, and monitoring and enforcing recreational fishing regulations. When designing specific management regulations, anglers tended to prefer management measures such as restoring habitat, establishing minimum size limits, and providing artificial habitat."

The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

The main objective of the survey was to assess the current status of businesses in Lesotho, in relation to four principal factors, namely, water supply and sanitation, essential health services, investment climate in the country, land administration and modernization of the commercial legal system. The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%). In contrast, most jointly-owned enterprises had acquired plots through transfer from someone for cash (32.6%), followed by public sector agency grants (26.3%).  A significant proportion (69.8%) of enterprises did not have formally registered titles/documents to the premises that they used; The top reason for opting to rent/sublease business premises was not intending to acquire land, which was mentioned by 35.1 percent of enterprises.

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant Facility The performance evaluation of the IGP is structured according to five phases of IGP implementation that we have identified for each grant cycle: start-up, selection, implementing the award, completing the award, and revising the process. These five phases differ slightly from the six main steps identified in the IGP grant manual; however, all of the activities reflected in the grant cycle implementation figure (p. 19 of the grants manual) are included in the five phases below. We chose to establish slightly different grant cycle implementation phases so the performance evaluation can address a critical element not reflected in the IGP manual's phases: \u201crevising the process.\u201d This phase is a critical component of the performance evaluation of the IGP facility.    AIR's performance evaluation of the IGP is structured around the five phases of IGP implementation mentioned above. AIR will use the following overarching questions as a framework to the evaluation question design:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   Did the IGP adhere to its objectives:    1.  To increase and sustain the access of the poor to quality water and sanitation and improved drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    2.  To enhance the functioning of the water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems?    3.  To demonstrate an innovative approach or technology to improve water use, sanitation, and hygiene practices among the poor?    4.  To identify and provide assistance to innovative partnership arrangements, particularly through private sector engagement?    5.  To provide significant access by women and vulnerable groups to the IGP and its benefits?    6.  To expand opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generating activities related to water supply, sanitation, and drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    \u00b7   Did the grant selection process prioritize interventions based on its key objectives, and was process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects?    \u00b7   Is grant oversight sufficient?  Is it cost-effective?    \u00b7   How can the Innovation Grant Program better mobilize private-sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCC specifically or another organization best replicate this program?    Start-up: During start- up, we will investigate the effectiveness of the IGP solicitation process to potential grantees. Another key area of interest will be gathering the demographic information of the grantees. The evaluation of the IGP's start-up phase will be based on the questions below:    \u00b7   What is the implementation plan for the grants?    \u00b7   How is information about the program disseminated?     \u00b7   Have there been specific outreach and dissemination activities targeting potential grantees that are best qualified to provide high quality services to women's groups, poor communities, and new entrepreneurs?    \u00b7   Does the MCA provide assistance with grant development, funding guidelines, and budgeting?     \u00b7   Does MCA facilitate connections between (potential) applicants or between applicants and government agencies?    \u00b7   Do targeted communities and stakeholders understand the intention and structure of the grant program?     \u00b7   What is the proportion of grantees from each technical intervention area (i.e. solid waste removal)?     \u00b7   What are potential grantees' and their communities' expectations of the program?     \u00b7   How well informed are potential grantees of the application and selection process, and of the available resources and support to help them participate?    \u00b7   How many grantees apply and how many applications do grantees submit?    \u00b7   How many applications meet the basic qualifications for participation in the program?     \u00b7   Do the interventions supported by the IGP clearly benefit poor communities, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs?     \u00b7   To what extent do the number and nature of applications meet MCA expectations?     \u00b7   To what extent do the applications cover a broad range of services and service areas?    \u00b7   Are proposals received highly relevant to the proposal call area and well distributed across the different calls areas?     \u00b7   Do the problem statements and proposal calls address areas that key IGP stakeholders perceive to be high impact?    Selection: During selection, we will investigate the selection process of the IGP with particular focus on the scoring procedures of the grants. Additionally, AIR will also examine the ways in which selection decisions are communicated to the grantees. Selection questions include:    \u00b7   Does IGPM follow its rules for reviewing, rating, and ranking grant applications?     \u00b7   Are the reviewers adequately trained and supported?     \u00b7   Is the review process fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of potential grantees?    \u00b7   Are grantees notified of the grant decision in a timely and effective way?    \u00b7   Are grantees provided with feedback that enables them to improve their grant application and resubmit?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants understand and accept the outcome of the selection process?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants plan to resubmit revised applications?     \u00b7   Are rejected applicants requesting assistance with resubmission?     \u00b7   How many grants are awarded?     \u00b7   What is the average grant size?     \u00b7   What proportion of available funds is committed to accepted grants?     \u00b7   Is the grant selection process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects based on how the projects align with IGP investment criteria?     Implementing the award: During the implementation phase, we will investigate the process of implementing the award. AIR will closely examine the negotiations of grantees' contracts, the process in which funds are disbursed, and the ability of grantees to successfully meet their quarterly goals. Illustrative research questions include:    \u00b7   How did the negotiations of the contract impact the implementation of the award?     \u00b7   Are grantees adequately supported with necessary technical and managerial assistance?    \u00b7   Are funds transmitted to grantees in a timely and efficient way?     \u00b7   Are grantee spending and performance adequately and efficiently monitored?    \u00b7   Do grantees receive timely feedback on their performance?     \u00b7   How does MCA monitor its own performance in the operation of the grant program?    \u00b7   Is MCA meeting its own expectations for successful implementation of the grant program?     \u00b7   How well is the grant program integrated into other compact activities?    \u00b7   What proportion of awarded grant funds is spent on time and on target?     \u00b7   What proportion of grantees achieves their performance objectives at various points throughout the grant period?    \u00b7   Is MCA's oversight of the grants sufficient and cost effective in terms of spending and M&E targets? \u00b7   Does MCA-Zambia/IGPM verify that applicants have met quarterly milestones before awarding the conditional grant disbursements?     \u00b7   What percentages of applicants fail to receive disbursements on time due to failure to meet quarterly milestones?    Completing the award: During the completion phase of the award, we will investigate the sustainability and impact of the grantees' programs. In particular, how effective IGP efforts were in increasing access to clean water and sanitation to vulnerable communities. AIR will pay particular attention to grantees' ability to successfully sustain its programs efforts and the impacts of these programs on their catchment communities. As part of these efforts, AIR will examine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders regarding grantees' programs. However, it is important to note that a full assessment of IGP may not be possible due to the short timeframe.  Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   What proportion of grantees is still active in business at the end of the grant period?    \u00b7   What proportions of the grants demonstrate potentially viable, long-term, profit-generating business opportunities?     \u00b7   How do civil society organizations and policy makers perceive the changes the program has made to the overall infrastructure for water, sanitation, and drainage services in Lusaka?    \u00b7   How aware of the program are households, civil society organizations, policy makers, and other water and sanitation focused stakeholders?     \u00b7   Has the grantee spurred \u201ccopycat\u201d organizations?    \u00b7   Did the grantees feel that they received adequate time to thoroughly complete all of the interventions?    \u00b7    To what extent are the benefits of the program cited as reasons for larger systemic changes by policy makers and compact implementing entities?     \u00b7   What is policy makers and compact implementing entities' perception of the extent to which the program has created individual interventions and structures that are sustainable even after program funding ends?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new partnerships between organizations in water, sanitation, or solid waste value chain?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new private sector investment in the sector?    \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new/ refined models of pro-poor service delivery?     \u00b7   What is the perception of benefits to the poor and vulnerable populations?     Revising the process: During this phase, AIR will investigate IGP's ability to successfully meet its objectives. As part of this process, AIR will examine the ways in that the IGP process could be further improved. Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   How can the IGP better mobilize private sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCA specifically or another organization best replicate this program?"

Finley National Wildlife Refuge Road Safety Audit The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) defines a road safety audit (RSA) as a \u201cformal safety performance evaluation of an existing or future road or intersection by an independent, multidisciplinary team.\u201d When conducting an RSA, the audit team should be multidisciplinary and must consider the safety of all road users, qualitatively estimate and report on the road safety issues identified, and present suggestions for safety improvement.   Safety concerns raised by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS) led to an RSA for William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge (Finley NWR). On the Refuge roadways, safety concerns were identified regarding poor sight distance at multiple curves, high traffic speeds on the Refuge roads, high volumes of traffic stopping in the roadway to view wildlife, and drainage issues that result in roadway flooding during heavy rainfall.   A site visit was performed by Western Federal Lands (WFL), FWS, and Atkins staff in January of 2012 to identify the safety issues within and near the Finley NWR. During the site visit, the team observed driver behavior, identified potential roadside hazards, identified areas that may benefit from signing or geometric improvements, and noted the drainage issues within the Refuge. The RSA primarily focused on Bruce Road and Finley Refuge Road within the limits of the Refuge, as well as on the county roads that provide access to the Refuge. Several areas of concern were identified by the group during the site visit. At the western access of Finley Refuge Road and Bellfountain Road, sight distance to approaching northbound traffic is limited. Several areas were noted as having frequent conflicts between traffic stopped on the roadway to view wildlife and passing vehicular traffic. Pedestrian/vehicle conflicts were noted as concerns in several locations as well.   The FWS raised concerns regarding parking, circulation, and drainage issues within the Refuge along Finley Road and Bruce Road. These issues are discussed in greater detail in a separate document, the William L Finley Transportation Study, scheduled to be completed later in 2012."

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).    Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Causes of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

The NAS is a highly complex dynamic system that is    sensitive to aeronautical decision-making and risk management    skills. In order to ensure a healthy system with safe    flights a systematic approach to anomaly detection is very    important when evaluating a given set of circumstances    and for determination of the best possible course of action.    Given the fact that the NAS is a vast and loosely integrated    network of systems, it requires improved safety assurance    capabilities to maintain an extremely low accident rate    under increasingly dense operating conditions. Data mining    based tools and techniques are required to support and aid    operators\u2019 (such as pilots, management, or policy makers)    overall decision-making capacity. Within the NAS, the    ability to analyze fleetwide aircraft data autonomously is    still considered a significantly challenging task. For our    purposes a fleet is defined as a group of aircraft sharing    generally compatible parameter lists. Here, in this effort,    we aim at developing a system level analysis scheme. In this    paper we address the capability for detection of fleetwide    anomalies as they occur, which itself is an important    initiative toward the safety of the real-world flight operations.    The flight data recorders archive millions of data    points with valuable information on flights everyday. The    operational parameters consist of both continuous and discrete    (binary & categorical) data from several critical subsystems    and numerous complex procedures. In this paper,    we discuss a system level anomaly detection approach based    on the theory of kernel learning to detect potential safety    anomalies in a very large data base of commercial aircraft.    We also demonstrate that the proposed approach uncovers    some operationally significant events due to environmental,    mechanical, and human factors issues in high dimensional,    multivariate Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA)    data. We present the results of our detection algorithms on    real FOQA data from a regional carrier."

The primary purpose of the Refuge is to provide habitat for four of Hawaii\u2019s endangered waterbirds. In recent years the alien apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) has become established throughout many of the Hawaiian Islands. This snail, as well as similar species in the genus Pila, are serious pests to wetland crops such as rice and taro. These snails are restricted to freshwater habitats and have been transported to additional river drainages either intentionally, as a marketable food item, by accident, or by dispersal up streams or over emergent lands during times of flooding or high water.  Numerous copper compounds are used as invertebrate pesticides. This study will provide information on the effects of copper sulfate pesticides when they are applied only rarely and in limited areas. Comparisons will be made with comparable taro fields or water impoundments that have received regular and repeated applications of the pesticide. This will provide information on fate, transport, and effects for management consideration of future applications within the Refuge. There are two objectives to be addressed in the proposed study. These are to determine the fate and transport of copper sulfate, where it ends up in the ecosystem; and to determine the effects of the pesticide on a subset of the resident, non-target fauna."

Most modern commercial aircraft record several hundred flight parameters including information from the guidance, navigation, and control systems, the avionics and propulsion systems, and the pilot inputs into the aircraft. These parameters may be continuous measurements or binary or categorical measurements recorded in one second intervals for the duration of the flight. Currently, most approaches to aviation safety are reactive, meaning that they are designed to react to an aviation safety incident or accident. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach based on the theory of multiple kernel learning to detect potential safety anomalies in very large data bases of discrete and continuous data from world-wide operations of commercial fleets. We pose a general anomaly detection problem which includes both discrete and continuous data streams, where we assume that the discrete streams have a causal influence on the continuous streams. We also assume that atypical sequences of events in the discrete streams can lead to off-nominal system performance. We discuss the application domain, novel algorithms, and also discuss results on real-world data sets. Our algorithm uncovers operationally significant events in high dimensional data streams in the    aviation industry which are not detectable using state of the art methods."

Of the eleven, ten were observed during the standardized Atlantic coast index count and eight were identified as breeding pairs on the property. Overall the eight breeding pairs produced 11 nests, 23 chicks, and 9 fledglings or 1.1 fledgling per breeding pair. Nest failures in 1994 resulted from predation, 36% (4/11), and flooding by spring new moon high tides, .09% (1/11). Protection efforts in 1994 focused more attention on early season demarkation and protection of suitable nesting habitat with symbolic fencing and signs, and the use of predator exclosures at 27% (3/11) nest sites.  Use of exclosures in 1994 was successful with 100% (3/3) ofthe exclosed nests hatching. It is recommended that use of exclosures be extended in 1995 to include all nest attempts, with continued close monitoring of predator activity and the physical functioning of the exclosures. Chick mortality continued to be high on the site with just 39% (9 of 23) of the chicks hatched surviving to fledge. Vehicle restrictions continued in 1994 in compliance with theMassachusetts Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (MDFW) Guidelines for protection of Piping Plovers.

In recent years, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) safety offices have been researching ways to utilize the many safety databases maintained by the FAA, such as those involving flight recorders, radar tracks, weather, and many other high-volume sensors, in order to monitor this unique and complex system. Although a number of current technologies do monitor the frequency of known safety risks in the NAS, very few methods currently exist that are capable of analyzing large data repositories with the purpose of discovering new and previously unmonitored safety risks. While monitoring the frequency of known events in the NAS enables mitigation of already identified problems, a more proactive approach of finding unidentified issues still needs to be addressed. This is especially important in the proactive identification of new, emergent safety issues that may result from the planned introduction of advanced NextGen air traffic management technologies and procedures. Development of an automated tool that continuously evaluates the NAS to discover both events exhibiting flight characteristics indicative of safety-related concerns as well as operational anomalies will heighten the awareness of such situations in the aviation community and serve to increase the overall safety of the NAS. This paper discusses the extension of previous anomaly detection work to identify operationally significant flights within the highly complex airspace encompassing the New York area of operations, focusing on the major airports of Newark International (EWR), LaGuardia International (LGA), and John F. Kennedy International (JFK). In addition, flight traffic in the vicinity of Denver International (DEN) airport/airspace is also investigated to evaluate the impact on operations due to variances in seasonal weather and airport elevation. From our previous research, subject matter experts determined that some of the identified anomalies were significant, but could not reach conclusive findings without additional supportive data. To advance this research further, causal examination using domain experts is continued along with the integration of air traffic control (ATC) voice data to shed much needed insight into resolving which flight characteristic(s) may be impacting an aircraft's unusual profile. Once a flight characteristic is identified, it could be included in a list of potential safety precursors. This paper also describes a process that has been developed and implemented to automatically identify and produce daily reports on flights of interest from the previous day."

This data set is one of 17 data sets (1 output data set and 16 input data sets) associated with the GWAVA-S model. Full details of the model development are in Nolan and Hitt (2006). For inputs to the model, spatial attributes representing 16 nitrogen loading and transport and attenuation factors were compiled as raster data sets (1-km by 1-km grid cell size) for the conterminous United States (see table 1). >Table 1.-- Parameters of nonlinear regression model for nitrate in shallow > ground water (GWAVA-S) and corresponding input spatial data sets. > [kg, kilograms; km2, square kilometers.] > >Nitrogen Source Factors Data Set Name > 1 farm fertilizer (kg/hectare) gwava-s_ffer > 2 confined manure (kg/hectare) gwava-s_conf > 3 orchards/vineyards (percent) gwava-s_orvi > 4 population density (people/km2) gwava-s_popd > 5 cropland/pasture/fallow (percent) gwava-s_crpa > >Transport to Aquifer Factors > 6 water input (km2/cm) gwava-s_wtin > 7 carbonate rocks (yes/no) gwava-s_crox > 8 basalt and volcanic rocks (yes/no) gwava-s_vrox > 9 drainage ditch (km2) gwava-s_ddit > 10 slope (percent x 1000) gwava-s_slop > 11 glacial till (yes/no) gwava-s_gtil > 12 clay sediment (percent x 1000) gwava-s_clay > >Attenuation Factors > 13 fresh surface water withdrawal gwava-s_swus > for irrigation (megaliters/day) > 14 irrigation tailwater recovery (km2) gwava-s_twre > 15 histosol soil type (percent) gwava-s_hist > 16 wetlands (percent) gwava-s_wetl \"Farm fertilizer\" is the average annual nitrogen input from commercial fertilizer applied to agricultural lands, 1992-2001, in kilograms per hectare. \"Confined manure\" is the average annual nitrogen input from confined animal manure, 1992 and 1997, in kilograms per hectare. \"Orchards/vineyards\" is the percent of orchards/vineyards land cover classification. \"Population density\" is 1990 block group population density, in people per square kilometer. \"Cropland/pasture/fallow\" is the percent of cropland/pasture/fallow land cover classifications. \"Water input\" is the ratio of the total area of irrigated land to precipitation, in square kilometers per centimeter. \"Carbonate rocks\" is the presence or absence of Valley and Ridge carbonate rocks. \"Basalt and volcanic rocks\" is the presence or absence of basalt and volcanic rocks. \"Drainage ditch\" is the area of National Resources Inventory surface drainage, field ditch conservation practice, in square kilometers. \"Slope\" is the soil surface slope, in percent times 1000. \"Glacial till\" is the presence or absence of poorly sorted glacial till east of the Rocky Mountains. \"Clay sediment\" is the amount of clay sediment in the soil, in percent times 1000. \"Fresh surface water withdrawal for irrigation\" is the amount of fresh surface water withdrawal for irrigation, in megaliters per day. \"Irrigation tailwater recovery\" is the area of National Resources Inventory irrigation system, tailwater recovery conservation practice, in square kilometers. \"Histosol soil type\" is the amount of histosols soil taxonomic order, in percent. \"Wetlands\" is the percent of woody wetlands and emergent herbaceous wetlands land cover classifications.

My time while on the mainland was pretty well taken up with hunting the big brown bear of that country, but I always had a welcome eye for birds and now that I am home in the east and the trip in retrospect it is questionable whether bears or birds gave me the most pleasure but certain it is that one without the other would have left a void. The country surrounding this great bay is inhabited for about six months every year and then only by a limited number of trappers who make their homes on the outlying islands and come here in the Fall and leave in the Spring. The shore of the main bay is indented by smaller bays and each has its trapper's shack or barabara, and as the men usually trap in pairs the population amounts to about two exclusive of any women and children for each bay. The trappers arrive when most of the birds are either gone or travelling south and leave when they are coming in so that the birds of this big section of country are practically unmolested save by some of the predatory members of their own family and a few four-footed hunters. The country remains wild and in its original state and offer every attraction to breeding birds in the way of shore, grass, shrubbery and cliffs; everything but large trees of any kind, for these last do not grow on this part of the peninsula."

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC."

This area lies east of the Missouri River and covers about 35,000 square miles or 45 percent of the state. Both the Central and Mississippi Flyways overlap in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) with large numbers of migratory birds using the corridor during the spring and fall migrations. South Dakota is considered a leader in waterfowl production in the lower 48 states. In 1989, South Dakota was ranked first in waterfowl production and in any given five year period South Dakota consistently ranks    second. Besides being eminent to migratory birds, the area is also important to resident wildlife as well, and can be considered the heart of the South Dakota pheasant range. Endangered species are present in the area including bald eagles which winter along the Missouri River, the largest concentration of which occurs in the Karl Mundt National    Wildlife Refuge, and at Pierre.   The wetland component associated with the Mid-Dakota project is unique as it proposes to utilize both the resources of the rural water system and environment to enhance, restore and create wetland acres. As proposed, the wetland component will consist of the following:    1. Enhancement of existing wetlands utilizing untreated Mid-Dakota rural water.    2. Enhancement of existing wetlands utilizing treated Mid-Dakota rural water.    3. Development of constructed wetlands.    4. Restoration of drained wetlands.    5.

The site-specific interventions in priority bairros within Nampula city and Monapo vila are the subject of this impact evaluation. Activities to be evaluated include: a) Satellite mapping and inventory exercise; b) Capacity building of the local cadastral offices; c) Piloting a sound approach to area-wide registration of land rights.  The evaluation approach is to use a non-experimental comparison group difference-in-difference (DiD) design approach for this evaluation. Data was collected at household level from both the treatment and control areas before and after the intervention. The baseline report for the evaluation presents the results of the baseline survey conducted in 2010-11 of 1,690 households in two urban cities of Nampula province. The results of the baseline data analysis aim to provide a picture of the status of surveyed households in study areas of Nampula city and Monapo vila across three broad categories: a) socio-economic characteristics (i.e., demographics, sources of income, asset holdings, and access to credit; b) land characteristics (i.e., land ownership, land markets, land investments, perceptions on tenure security and knowledge about land law and rights); and c) welfare characteristics (i.e., level of income, consumption and expenditure).

This evaluation covers Activity III site specific land access in rural areas.  It is important to note that both comparisons and treatments of this evaluation are being affected by both the nation-wide policy activity (Activity I) and the institutional strengthening activity of the local district offices (Activity II).  This evaluation essentially evaluates the effects of receiving all three activities versus only receiving Activity I and Activity II.  Assuming the effects of Activity I and Activity II are constant in both the treatment and comparison areas, then the identified effects through this evaluation exercise is to evaluate the impacts of 'the site specific activities (Activity III) in rural hotspot areas.  The evaluation assesses changes in three broad categories: a) socio-economic characteristics (i.e., demographics, sources of income, asset holdings, and access to credit; b) land characteristics (i.e., land ownership, land markets, land investments, perceptions on tenure security and knowledge about land law and rights); and c) welfare characteristics (i.e., level of income, consumption and expenditure, and poverty status)."

First, we calculate economic rates of return associated with reduced user costs for each rehabilitated road - and for the project in aggregate - making use of the before and after measures of road use, detailed data on project implementation and costs, and models that project changes in usage, costs, and benefits over time.   We also examine changes in the availability and cost of common consumption goods that can be attributed to the transportation project. This component of the analysis relies on a survey of retail establishments that targets goods in the Cansta Basica or basic basket that is used in Nicaragua to track consumer prices. Data was collected both before and after construction in communities both on and away from rehabilitated roads. The survey design therefore facilitates measurement of changes in price and availability of goods relative to a relevant comparison group.   The evaluation also examines changes in household consumption using a similar pre- and post- rehabilitation data collection methodology. The consumption measures for this component of the evaluation are derived from responses to household surveys implemented for the Rural Business Development (RBD) portion of the Nicaragua compact. While the bulk of the respondents to this survey are outside the zone of influence of the road rehabilitation, we identify more than one-hundred households within the zone of influence of the rehabilitated roads. It is important to recognize that the data for this component of the report was collected for a different purpose and respondents are not a representative sample of households in the treatment and control areas. Thus these results are intended to be suggestive and provide some insight on the robustness of results from the survey of retail establishments. These surveys do not provide unbiased estimates of the transportation project on the affected population."

Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).  The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, \"the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.\"  Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.  The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements. The minimum population for a locality to be included in the sample is 1,000, a condition imposed to help ensure that most designated items could be found in most localities.  Beginning in August 2009 interviewers visited the sample localities to obtain three price observations for each item in the defined \"basket\" of goods and transportation services. The final \"basket\" contains 39 fresh food items, 24 packaged food items, 19 non food items and 6 transportation tariffs-3 for the locality's residents' most frequent passenger destinations and 3 for the most frequent freight destinations."

As part of its commitment to transparently and thoroughly monitor and evaluate its activities, the MCC contracted NORC in 2007 to conduct an impact evaluation of its water sector activities. This report presents the Impact Evaluation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Activity (RWSSA).   RWSSA originally included 250 rural water supply points and 10,000 VIP latrines and had a budget of $30.2 million (18 percent of the $164-million Water Project in the Compact). In order to increase the coverage of VIP latrines in participating villages, MCC subsequently increased the budget to $40.1 million and the Government of Lesotho (GOL) contributed $17.1 million to RWSSA. In addition, the target for VIP latrines coverage was increased from 10,000 to 27,245 in the Lesotho M&E Plan.  When the Lesotho Compact ended in September 2013, 175 water systems (70% of the target) and 29,352 VIP latrines (108% of the target) had been installed.  Implementation continued post-Compact with approximately $5.3 million of additional funding from the GOL; ultimately, 250 water systems (100% of the target), and 31,768 VIP latrines (117% of the revised target), were completed. The total cost of RWSSA, including MCC and GOL funding during the Compact and after, was approximately $60 million.  Households impacted by the program are located in villages that were identified by the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) as lacking access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. To identify the effects of the program on the outcomes of interest, eligible villages were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The list of outcomes analyzed includes toilet use, type of water source used, time spent collecting water, diarrhea incidence and income, among others.   To evaluate the impact of the program we use data from the baseline and follow-up Impact Evaluation Multipurpose Surveys (IEMS). The IEMS is a longitudinal analytic survey specifically designed to collect data for the impact evaluations of the MCA-Lesotho Compact health and water (rural and urban) activities.  The baseline version of the survey included items on basic sociodemographics, household access to water and sanitation, water consumption, hygiene and health profiles. The follow-up version of the survey added a few labor outcome items to the instrument.  During program implementation construction delays in some treatment villages meant that construction works ended after follow-up data collection. As a consequence, randomization was compromised because the villages that were actually treated before follow-up data collection were a subset of the villages that were assigned to the treatment group originally. To tackle this problem the evaluation used Instrumental Variables (IV) methods in order to evaluate the effect of the program. This approach exploits the fact that treatment assignment was randomized, but it also addresses the fact that treatment was not provided as planned in all treatment villages.   The impact evaluation shows that the program has had significant effects on key wellbeing indicators. It found that households in the treatment group are more likely than in the control group to use as their main water source an improved water source, such as a public standpipe or a protected spring, as opposed to an unimproved source, such as an unprotected spring or surface water. They are also more likely to use a toilet and spend less time collecting water. However, the evaluation did not find any impacts significant at standard levels of confidence for any of the diarrhea incidence indicators analyzed, although most of the estimated effects have the (negative) expected sign.   The evaluation also did not find any effects for any labor outcomes, or income. An important exception to this is that it found that the program has a positive and significant effect on female labor participation. The evaluation discusses the mechanisms that can explain why the effects on labor outcomes are not more apparent. In particular, it is possible that time availability does not translate into better labor outcomes because the latter are not restricted by time availability but by other conditions, like the labor market itself.  In terms of policy implications, the results described in this report imply that this type of program can have major impacts on households wellbeing via reductions on time spent collecting water, but limited effects on higher level outcomes, like diarrhea incidence. Furthermore, even if household members spend less time collecting water as a result of the program, it is not clear that this will translate into a 1:1 increase in the number of hours they participate in the labor market, as labor outcomes may depend on more factors than just greater available time."

                "text": "Armenia - Rural Road Rehabilitation The key research questions guiding our design of the RRRP evaluation are:    \u2022 Did rehabilitating roads affect the quality of roads?    \u2022 Did rehabilitating roads improve access to markets and social services?    \u2022 Did rehabilitating roads affect agricultural productivity and profits, and if so, by how much?    \u2022 Did rehabilitating roads improve household well-being for communities served by these roads, especially income and poverty?  As is frequently the case for large scale infrastructure projects, it was not feasible to randomly select the roads that would be rehabilitated in the MCA RRRP from amongst the eligible. Instead, MCA planned to fund projects based on estimated economic rates of return (ERRs). The ERR is calculated from several inputs, including the vehicular traffic, vehicle operating costs, and the cost of the project, among others. An ERR was estimated for each of the road links under consideration for rehabilitation, and in order to be funded, a road\u2019s ERR had to meet or exceed 12.5 percent. However, the MCC Board subsequently made the decision to discontinue funding any further road construction and rehabilitation under the Compact due to concerns about Armenia's democratic governance. Starting in 2009, the Armenian government instead accessed loans from the World Bank to rehabilitate many road sections that were included in the RRRP plans before MCC discontinued funding, using and updating the road project designs developed by MCA-Armenia. These roads were selected based on estimated ERRs as well as other factors such as the size of the population who would benefit.  The evaluation of rural road rehabilitation uses a comparison group design. The evaluation design identifies the counterfactual by defining a comparison group of roads selected from those initially proposed by MCA that share similar characteristics as those selected by the World Bank, but that were not rehabilitated. The evaluators adopted a hybrid approach that matches road links based on a limited number of key observable characteristics and then uses regression modeling to control for other characteristics that may impact outcomes. The most fundamental criterion used in identifying potential comparison roads is that it is among the roads that were originally considered for rehabilitation by MCA, indicating that the road conditions are poor enough to consider rehabilitation.   The data for this evaluation  come from Armenia\u2019s Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS), an annual household survey fielded by Armenia\u2019s National Statistical Service (NSS). MCA funded a considerable increase in the rural sample, which was in part aimed at facilitating the RRRP evaluation. The sampling plans were developed and implemented based on the evaluation design described above. The evaluation includes households served by 27 roads that were rehabilitated with World Bank financing based on designs funded by MCA and 28 comparison roads."

Harvesting early during the maturation phase may result in yield reductions and higher nutrient removal in biomass depending on ecotype. Therefore, it is necessary to target harvest dates that optimize yield while minimizing nutrient removal per cultivar. Consequently, objectives were to compare yields from 2010\u20132011 on eight widely used and experimental upland and lowland genotype (whole plot) at two locations in Tennessee, to determine: (i) which harvest timing (split-plot) provides maximum yield; (ii) effects of harvest timing (mid-September, October, November, and late October) on overall total P and K removal; and, (iii) how results are affected by cultivar. Among all post-senescence harvests, yields peaked early November (13.2 Mg ha\u20131), which was greater than all other harvests (P [HTML_REMOVED] 0.05), with mid-October and late October not differing from one another. Because yields peaked in early November, P and K removal did not vary across harvest dates (despite both P and K concentrations declining mid-October). Lowland cultivars yielded 3.9 Mg ha\u20131 more biomass annually than upland entries, suggesting lowland cultivars are better suited to environments in the Southeast. Due to lower yields, P and K removals were lower for upland (Blackwell and C62), compared with lowland cultivars. Consequently, switchgrass can be harvested as early as mid-September without removing greater amounts of P and K, although variations within upland and lowland cultivars will likely occur."

On the other hand, recharge of the deep pervious beds is inferred to take place  largely within 5 miles from the head of the alluvial fan near Burns, where clean  gravel and sand form about 90 percent of the fill. Farther from the head of the  fan, confining beds prevent recharge of the deep pervious beds by downward  percolation. From several lines of evidence it is estimated that the average  annual recharge along the Silvies River is about 40,000 acre-feet, of whicn about 6,500 acre-feet could be pumped perennially from wells. In addit'on some water might be salvaged from the shallow pervious beds by growing alfalfa as a groundwater plant.  The water in the bedrock appears to fall into three distinct temperature ranges  slightly thermal water, 52\u00b0 to 62\u00b0 F.; water of intermediate temperature, 64\u00b0  to 82\u00b0 F.; and hot water, 90\u00b0 to 154\u00b0 F. The slightly thermal water has been  encountered in bedrock wells of moderate depth in the northern part of the  basin, where the safe yield of the aquifers appears to be at leart equal to the  safe yield of the valley fill. The water of intermediate temperature issues from  relatively large springs in three small districts in the west half of the basin; the  aggregate discharge by these springs in 1931 was about 40 second-feet. Water of intermediate temperature also issues from several flowing wells in the vicinity of the springs. The hot water issues from a few springs that are widely scattered over the basin, and their aggregate yield in 1931 was about 5 second-feet. It issues also from a deep flowing well in the southwestern part of the central alluvial plain. With few exceptions the thermal springs and the flowing thermal wells occur along or very near faults that cut the Tertiary rocks.  Six wells more than 500 feet deep have been drilled in the central plain in search of flowing water. The single deep well that was flowing in 1931 suggests that the artesian head is not large."

                "text": "Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study Introduction    Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.    Experimental Design    A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.    Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.    The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Methods    Vegetation and Soil Measurements    Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs (\uf03e 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide \u00d7 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm \u00d7 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.    Rainfall Simulations    Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105\u00b0C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).    Overland Flow Simulations    Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105\u00b0C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Resulting Data    The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.    Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center. This dataset is contribution number 134 of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project."

                "text": "Sediment Export to Nearshore Waters - Hawaii This raster data layer represents sediment plumes originating from stream mouths and coastal pour points. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model for sediment retention was modified for Hawaii, parameterized, and run for each of the Main Hawaiian Islands to determine sediment export from subwatershed hydrologic units (Falinski et al., in prep). Results from this model were aggregated into larger drainage areas that flow to single coastal pour points. From these points sediment was dispersed offshore using the Kernel Density tool in ArcGIS with a 1.5-km search radius. The resulting raster depicts simplistic sediment plumes with units in tons of sediment per year per hectare.  The InVEST model predicts the average annual amount of sediment (tons/yr) retained in and exported from each map pixel as a function of many landscape variables. Data inputs to InVEST included: 1) USGS 10-m Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 2) NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) land use/land cover data; 3) R factor (old USGS maps and interpolation); 4) K factor (USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO)); 5) University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH) rainfall atlas; 6) ArcHydro-derived subwatersheds such that flow lines approximately match the State of Hawaii streams layer; and 7) derived products from the above and more. See Falinski et al. (in prep) for detailed methodology.  Coastal pour points were created by intersecting streams and coastline features from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), resulting in points where streams flow to the shoreline. The NHD was used rather than flow lines generated from the DEM because there are many instances in Hawaii where streams flow into man-made ditch systems and never reach the coast or simply dry up and go underground before reaching the coast.  To determine the amount of sediment load at the coastline, resulting coastal points were given a unique drainage identifier. Next, the stream segment features were buffered by 1 m and dissolved so that connecting stream networks became single features. These polygon stream features were then assigned the drainage ID from the coastal points using a spatial join and subsequently used to assign that drainage ID to the subwatershed polygons. Finally, subwatersheds were dissolved by drainage ID and sediment export from each subwatershed was summed up to yield the total sediment export for each larger drainage basin, which was then joined back to the corresponding coastal drainage points. Each step in the process required quality control to ensure that: no pour points are left out, subwatersheds are not erroneously connected to the wrong drainage or left out, each drainage has only 1 pour point, and drainages do not erroneously span a ridgeline that should divide basins."

Pond occupancy by duck pairs averaged 37% during mid-May counts and 48% for late May and early June counts. A positive linear relation occurred between the estimated number of duck pairs and the percent of basins with water during 1-15 May.  There were 3,339 duck nests found in grassland habitats from 1966 through 1981. Approximately 66% (85% Mayfield)    of these were depredated or abandoned. Mammals caused 88% of nest failures. Half or more of the eventually    successful clutches were unhatched by 10 July in 9 of 16 years. Haying would have disturbed or destroyed an average of 43%, 33%, 22%, 15%, and 9% of the duck nests if initiated on 10 July, 15 July, 20 July, 25 July, and 1 August,    respectively.  The total average size of completed clutch for all species was 29% smaller at the end of the nesting season than at the beginning, underscoring the importance of protecting early clutches.  Production averaged 30 broods per 100 pairs of ducks and ranged from 15 to 61 broods per 100 pairs. Brood densities    ranged from 10 to 63/km2 and averaged 12/km2. Mean brood size averaged 6.4 for all species. July broods averaged 7.2 ducklings and August broods 5.7 ducklings. Duckling loss averaged 2.6 per brood and 85% (2.2 ducklings) of this loss was estimated to occur during the first 14 days after hatch.  Wetlands of all sizes and classes were important at ome time to one species of duck or another. With the exception of    some diving ducks, all species used a complex of sizes and classes of wetlands for space, food, and shelter necessary for nesting and brooding. Pair counts during 20 May-7 June were most indicative of the breeding population. A    combination of two brood counts resulted in the best estimate of annual production. An average of only 50% of the total duck broods per year was counted during the 1-15 July surveys, which approximated the average time of the Service's July aerial surveys. During this study the area produced in average of 1 duck per 4 ha of upland and had a nest density of approximately 1 nest per 14 ha. Nest success rates averaged 36.1% (16.3% Mayfield). Predation was significantly reduced by good vegetative cover at nest sites. Seeded grasslands (dense nesting cover) yielded better production than native prairie or croplands. Seeded grasslands also produced 3 times more ducklings per unit area than adjacent native prairie and more than 14 times as many as adjacent, annually tilled croplands.  Ducks generally showed higher neat densities and better nesting success when using growing grain crops than when nesting in standing or mulched stubble fields. Among native mixed-grass; prairie and seeded grassland, production was enhanced by leaving fields idle or by treating them with periodic burning. Duck production was generally lowered by grazing fields of native prairie but duck production on grazing lands was higher than in annually tilled croplands.

This data contains baseline information for the impact evaluation of this activity.  Treatment groups involve households with farmers who belong to FBOs within the geographic perimeters of the new/renovated irrigation schemes; these treatment groups are provided contracted access to an anchor farm that will enable them to receive irrigation. Comparison groups are households outside the water supply perimeters provided by the new/renovated irrigation scheme with characteristics similar to those of households in the treatment groups.   The three main research questions this evaluation will try to answer (once endline data is collected), presented in form of hypotheses to be tested, are: i) new irrigation schemes will raise production from 2 to 3 crops per year; ii) irrigation will allow for diversification of crops and potentially higher yields; and iii) irrigation will increase labor requirements. From these three hypotheses, there are five indicators that can be used to measure the impact of these irrigation activities: (1) total household income; (2) total household income from crop production; (3) paid employment per household; (4) crop mix - annual production output (kilograms) for each of the five most imported crops per household (i.e. want to observe move from low to high-value crops); and (5) crop yield (i.e. monitor output per unit, kilogram/hectare per crop cycle).  To evaluate this program, once endline data is collected, NORC proposed to use a difference-in-difference approach and an IV approach based on a distance indicator (i.e. instrument treatment with \u201cfarmer's distance from anchor farm\u201d if we can assume small farms closer to anchor farms are more likely to benefit from activity).  In terms of descriptive statistics there is no clear evidence that households in the treatment group are better or worse off than households in the comparison group at baseline. There are, however, important differences to consider. While the household head in the treatment group is more likely to be female, slightly less educated, and live in an informal dwelling, they were more likely to have children currently attending school. Households within the treatment group also had, on average, higher income, though the variance was high (as is the case with income in general), and the difference was not statistically significant. With respect to farming activities, there are two important differences to highlight across experimental groups. First, households in comparison groups were more likely to own their own plots. This is important because the impact of irrigation activities could be confounded if the households in the treatment group are less likely to make long-term investments than households in the comparison group. Second, households in the treatment group owned smaller plots of land in terms of area, on average."

The RBD program helped finance irrigation equipment, inputs, and extension services for plantain producers, as well as extension, inputs, and drying patios for rice producers in 2009 and 2010; the price of rice is a function of its moisture content, and by increasing access to drying patios the RBD program sought to increase the value of sales by producers. Using a unique data set collected for the evaluation, average impacts of the RBD program on participating plantain farmers were estimated using difference-in-differences, while average impacts of the rice component on beneficiaries were estimated using fixed effects regressions. Estimated program impacts were combined with administrative cost data to calculate an internal rate of return for the plantain program and for one aspect of the rice program (construction of drying patios).  Key results of the evaluation are:     -Estimated impacts suggest that the RBD rice program raised yields and revenues by 11% in the 2009 - 2010 growing season and 18% in 2010 - 2011 on average relative to the yields and revenues beneficiaries would have obtained without the program.     -The estimated ERR of the drying patio component of the RBD rice program ranges from 7% under the assumption of a five year lifespan for drying patios to 27% when assuming a 20 year lifespan.     -No ERR was estimated for the input/extension component of the rice program; part of the value of the extension/input bundles received by beneficiaries was to be paid back by each beneficiary farmer to his or her cooperative, and the sum total of payments was to serve as seed money for credit funds managed by cooperatives in future years. The  reliance of future benefits of this program component on farmer repayment performance makes its long-term value uncertain; therefore I chose to focus my ERR calculation on the drying patios.     -While average impacts and the drying patio ERR are both positive, RBD rice program impacts are estimated imprecisely, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that average impacts of the program on yields and revenues were zero.     -Estimated impacts of the RBD plantain program were large and significant for revenues and yields of first quality plantains (harvested plantains come in three different quality grades).     -The average impact of the RBD program on sales suggests that the program raised the value of plantain sales by 72% relative to what beneficiaries would have obtained without the RBD program.     -I use the estimated impact on revenues as well as administrative data on production costs and program costs to estimate the ERR of the plantain program.     -The plantain ERR ranges from -23% when assuming a lifespan of 5 years for irrigation equipment and 13% when assuming a lifespan of 20 years.     -The apparent discrepancy between large impacts on sales and the modest ERR is a reflection of the high cost per beneficiary of the program, which was around $15,062 per farmer for the cohort studied here (around $3.6 million divided by 239 beneficiaries)."

Two hour searches by a two person team were conducted along specific transects in a moist soil management unit, rice fields, and fallowed rice fields, twice a month between March and July, and once a month between August and November for two years. All amphibians seen or heard were recorded, or captured when possible, and examined for gross malformations. Small dip nets were used to collect tadpoles for external examination and growth observations. Three herbicides [Stam M-4 (propanil), Grazon P+D (picloram + 2,4-D) and Arrosolo (propanil + molinate)] that were approved for use, and used on the Refuge during the study, were tested for toxicity in the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay - Xenopus (FETAX) of these chemicals to larval amphibians. Dose-response curves are presented and the LC50s were calculated for Grazon P+D and Arrosolo (33% propanil, 33% molinate). Stam M-4 did not yield a definitive test. The LC50 for Grazon P+D was between 25 and 50 mg/L and for Arrosolo the LC50 was 13.5 mg/L. Calculated exposure concentration of Arrosolo used in rice farming on the Refuge was less than 0.6 mg/L, which is 200 times lower than the LC50 determined in the FETAX assay. Fourteen species of frogs, toads and salamanders were recorded on the Refuge during this study. Three species (three-toed amphiuma, western lesser siren and pig frog) were not previously recorded in Chambers County, Texas. Six species of amphibians recorded from Chambers County (Dixon 1987) were not seen during this study (Table 1). In August the moist soil management unit generally contained the largest population of amphibians averaging 26 individuals per hectare and represented 10 species. The rice fields had the second largest population of amphibians and averaged 24 individuals per hectare, representing 11 species, during July. The rice field was usually drained and left to dry out in August for harvesting. The fallowed rice fields had only eight species of amphibians and much lower densities. These fields were not flooded and stayed dry for long time periods during the drought period of 1999 and 2000. Surveys in the months of December, January, or February did not yield any amphibians along the transects. There were no malformed frogs, toads or tadpoles collected during this study which indicates that the herbicides currently used on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge are not having a measurable adverse effect on the amphibian populations. Habitat alteration such as discing, leveling, and terracing the area for rice planting appeared to have a large but short-term negative effect on the presence, reproduction and abundance of amphibians. The role of concentrating predators such as birds, snakes and mammals, in the moist soil unit and the rice fields on the amphibian populations was not evaluated, but appears as if it could be substantial."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

Some hatchery managers have expressed concern that automated trailers may cause injuries at rates higher than historic marking and tagging techniques. To begin addressing these concerns, in 2006 we evaluated the two types of marking trailers at Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery, Oregon. To complement the study at Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery, in 2008 spring Chinook salmon at Carson National Fish Hatchery were adipose fin marked and coded wire tagged using both an automated and manual marking trailer. Fish injuries, fin mark quality, and coded wire tag retention rates were compared between the two trailers. Fish were randomly sampled from each trailer and evaluated in a single blind experiment. Injury rates, fin mark quality, and tag retention rates did not significantly differ between the two trailer types. The ability of these two types of trailers to tag fish without any differential injury, clip quality, or tag retention rates allows hatchery managers at Carson National Fish Hatchery to use either trailer with assurance that fish are being marked and tagged in accordance with the expected standards. Availability of experienced markers, cost, time constraints and many other factors should be considered when deciding what type of trailer to use when marking and tagging salmon at a particular fish hatchery."

These infestations are largely resulting from extensive ground work conducted in the refuge work yards in the last few years that opened new areas for infestation, coupled with mistimed mechanical control efforts that ended up spreading seeds rather than preventing their formation. Hart Mountain Refuge currently has very limited equipment to implement effective IPM prevention strategies; this equipment currently consists of an inoperative consumer-grade (home-owner) cold-water pressure washer and a standard-pressure garden hose with a spray nozzle. Better than nothing, but not by much. The work yard infestations, and the efforts needed to control them and prevent their spread, are distinct problems that have advanced beyond the Refuge\u2019s current ability to control using base funds.Grant funds would be used to purchase the following as part of an integrated IPM strategy: 1) herbicides and adjuvants to get the work yard infestations under control; 2) native grass seed to establish vegetative buffer zones between the work yards and surrounding native habitats; 3) a hot-water pressure washer system for use on equipment and vehicles at the headquarters maintenance yard; and 4) a water tank trailer with draft pump, a (functional) professional-grade cold-water pressure washer system, and misc. parts and accessories, for use at project sites. Chemicals will include pre-emergent and generalist tank mix partners (e.g., Viewpoint\u00ae, Esplanade 200SC\u00ae and glyphosate) to re-establish and maintain bareground in the graveled vehicle use areas, and broadleaf herbicides (e.g., MCPA, 2,4-D amine, fluroxypyr, bromoxynil, dicamba) to be used in tank mixes to develop/augment and maintain native grass-based buffer zones between the work yards and the surrounding native shrub-steppe habitats. To minimize the risk of developed resistance, herbicides will be used in subsequent years (as necessary) following a BMP rotational strategy/tank mix partnership based on mode of action, chemical group/family and chemical structure. Native grass seed mixes will be applied in these buffer zones to develop a zone that can be easily maintained against invasive broadleaves using competitive, chemical and/or mechanical methods with minimal staff effort. The pressure washers and water tank trailer will be used to prevent spread of invasive species by vehicle/equipment from the work yards to native habitats, from project sites to other areas of the refuge, and between refuges/other areas (note: Sheldon Refuge already has a hot-water pressure washer system at their maintenance yard)."

To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

                "text": "Scenic Overlooks WITHIN the compass of this heading is included a wide range of structures, the common denominator of all being the provision of means for negotiating a view. Lookouts may eventuate from the practical requirement of forest fire detection, or from determination on the part of designing technician or wilful band of park users, hyper-view conscious, for something bigger and better and more distant in views than Nature unaided could achieve.Between the grimly functional lookout of the ranger and the utmost in aesthetic structural elevation contrived by the view-for-view's-sakers is greater distance than any park vista will ever provide. When it has been essayed to superimpose the too conscious aspirations of the aesthetic, on the structurally sufficient skeleton of the fire detection tower, the literally \"crowning\" error in park development has been committed. Probably a frank rendering of either extreme, free of gesture toward the other, is better than any hybrid produced by crossing the two irreconcilables.Examination of existing timber-framed trestle-type lookout towers for aesthetic values will prove disheartening. In general, the oil derrick as their inspirational source is painfully undisguised. This conclusion cannot be held in disparagement of the designers, if it be honestly admitted that they have valiantly sought to solve the unsolvable. There is such admirable show of there-is-no-such-word-as-can't in every new attempt! It seems heartless to venture a restraining word, but the accumulation in our parks of harrowing skeletons commemorative of past ill-advised best intentions in this direction admits no choice of action.There are other than purely aesthetic reasons for discouraging the building of high wooden structures for use as observation towers. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate a timber-braced structure with bolted or spiked joints that will hold up under the attack of the elements for any considerable length of time without constant maintenance. Immediately after construction the wood members shrink and the joints loosen. Decay will proceed rapidly at the joints where water seeps in between the members and finally into the bolt and spike holes. The structure is weakened at its most vulnerable point. With the slightest loosening of the joints the tremendous wind pressures cause movements which increase the stresses in the entire structure. The safety of the people using the towers cannot be assured, when it depends entirely on inspection and maintenance that cannot be guaranteed into the future.Because the wood-framed lookout tower is so utterly unappealing, and so potentially a hazard, it is strange that but few stone towers have been built. The stone lookout is not foredoomed to failure, aesthetic and structural, as is the open wood tower, but on the contrary offers opportunity for picturesqueness, satisfying design and great permanence. Particularly does it appear that the possibilities for a stone tower of modest height springing from a rock-crowned summit have not been widely sensed, certainly not widely embraced.It is held by many that the birth rate for lookout towers in parks is currently too high, and that some measure of control should be instituted. It can be argued that the perching of a lookout on the high elevation of a park area is disfiguring to the natural sky line, that it is sometimes better to remove the trees that crown the high summit, and are the very obstructions to view that make necessary the building of a structural lookout. The bald crown of the eminence is held to be a lesser, certainly no greater, blemish than the structural tower rearing itself above trees. There are undoubtedly locations where this solution would be an acceptable alternative to a lookout tower. But it can hardly be urged for universal application. Rather should it be given thoughtful consideration as a possibility, to be weighed in the light of consideration of characteristics of hill or mountain t"

Because the size (ha) of overwintering habitat area colony occupied by the core North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus plexippus) population has greatly declined since peak coverage during the 1990s, the USFWS and the Monarch Joint Venture have established national and regional initiatives to increase numbers of monarchs and reduce the threat of extinction.  The aim of this monitoring strategy is to demonstrate the effectiveness of conservation efforts.   Strategically, the monitoring will be designed to: 1) determine the status and trends of the monarch over broad spatial extents and identify factors potentially driving those trends, 2) inform local efforts on the efficiency and effectiveness of habitat restoration efforts, and 3) engage citizens in collecting data and promoting monarch conservation.  A key element of this effort is the use of information on the response of monarchs and food resources to localized habitat management to inform and evaluate a broader scale model of population response and viability.  Another vital aspect of the effort is to incorporate citizens into the monitoring program.  Engaging the public will not only strengthen conservation awareness, it could also allow less-costly collection of data on factors that may influence migration and availability of food resources over a large area. Operationally, an integrated monitoring program will entail a large-scale sampling design and collection of a core set of attributes using existing protocols and data portals whenever appropriate.  Employing a large-scale sampling design will help identify locations where core data should be collected and emphasize how partners can best contribute to conservation monitoring."

SOCAT is a synthesis activity by the international marine carbon research community and has more than 100 contributors worldwide. SOCAT provides access to synthesis and gridded, quality controlled, observational products of surface ocean fCO2 (fugacity of carbon dioxide) for the global oceans and coastal seas. SOCAT version 6 has 23.4 million, in situ, surface ocean fCO2 measurements with an accuracy of better than 5 \u00ce\u00bcatm and a WOCE flag of 2 (good) from 1957 to 2017. Calibrated sensor data with an accuracy of better than 10 \u00ce\u00bcatm are also available. During quality control, marine scientists assign a flag to each data set, as well as WOCE flags of 2 (good), 3 (questionable) or 4 (bad) to individual fCO2 values. Data sets are assigned flags of A and B for an accuracy of better than 2 \u00ce\u00bcatm, flags of C and D for an accuracy of better than 5 \u00ce\u00bcatm and a flag of E for an accuracy of better than 10 \u00ce\u00bcatm. Bakker et al. (2016) describe the quality control criteria used in SOCAT versions 3 to 6. Quality control comments for individual data sets can be accessed via the SOCAT Data Set Viewer (www.socat.info). All data sets, where data quality has been deemed acceptable, have been made public. The main SOCAT synthesis files and the gridded products contain all data sets with flags of A to D and fCO2 values with a flag of 2. Access to data sets with a flag of E and fCO2 values with flags of 3 and 4 is via additional data products and the Data Set Viewer (Table 8 in Bakker et al., 2016). SOCAT publishes a global gridded product with a 1\u00c2\u00b0 longitude by 1\u00c2\u00b0 latitude resolution. A second product with a higher resolution of 0.25\u00c2\u00b0 longitude by 0.25\u00c2\u00b0 latitude is available for the coastal seas. Gridded products are available monthly, per year and per decade. Two powerful, interactive, online viewers, the Data Set Viewer and the Gridded Data Viewer (www.socat.info), enable investigation of the SOCAT synthesis and gridded data products. SOCAT data products can be downloaded. Matlab code is available for reading these files. Ocean Data View also provides access to the SOCAT data products (www.socat.info). SOCAT data products are discoverable, accessible and citable. SOCAT versions 3 to 6 should be cited as Bakker et al., 2016 (until a publication on versions 4, 5 and 6 is published). The SOCAT Fair Data Use Statement (www.socat.info) asks users to generously acknowledge the contribution of SOCAT scientists by invitation to co-authorship, especially for data providers in regional studies, and/or reference to relevant scientific articles. The SOCAT website (www.socat.info) provides a single access point for online viewers, downloadable data sets, the Fair Data Use Statement, a list of contributors and an overview of scientific publications on and using SOCAT. Automation of data upload and initial data checks allows annual releases of SOCAT from version 4 onward.

(2) How was the activity implemented? (3) Did the activity produce its desired results, and what is the extent of the relevant evidence? (4) What was learned about supporting enterprise development and how sustainable are MCC's efforts in this area? and (5) What are the lessons for MCC and other stakeholders from the design and implementation of this activity?    This analysis relies on a mixed-methods approach, in which Mathematica staff collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data from a variety of sources, including administrative records, programmatic reports, and stakeholder interviews. In July 2012, Mathematica staff conducted interviews with MCC, FOMILENIO, Chemonics, and technical service provider staff, as well as members of FOMILENIO's board of directors, an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, representatives from S\u00faper Selectos (a major grocery store chain in El Salvador), PBS participants, and representatives from FOMILENIO-supported enterprises. To formulate primary findings and conclusions, Mathematica staff triangulated qualitative information provided by all interviewed stakeholders and analyzed this information in conjunction with administrative reports and records.  Interim Impact Evaluation:    The Productive Development Project (PDP) was one of three large-scale projects financed under the 2006 compact between the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of El Salvador. The main objective of the PDP was to assist in the development of profitable and sustainable business ventures for poor individuals in El Salvador's Northern Zone. Between 2008 and 2012, the PDP used nearly $72 million in allocated funds to serve over 13,500 participants and create more than 11,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The PDP comprised three activities: Production and Business Services (PBS), Investment Support, and Financial Services. The PBS Activity -- the subject of this impact evaluation and the largest of the three activities -- provided technical and material assistance to farmers and small-scale producers to support the Northern Zone's dairy, fruit, horticulture, handicrafts, tourism, forestry, and coffee sectors.  The design for the impact evaluation of the PBS Activity is a randomized rollout design, in which some producers were offered PBS assistance several months before other producers were offered similar assistance. The goal of this design is to attain the highest level of rigor possible without significantly altering existing implementation plans. The evaluation is limited to three value chains: (1) handicrafts, (2) dairy, and (3) horticulture. Among all value chains in the PBS, these three chains were most amenable to random assignment, and were expected to yield impacts in the one-year interim timeline specified for the evaluation.   Treatment groups were offered PBS assistance in the first implementation phase (beginning in late 2009 for handicrafts and mid-2010 in the case of the dairy and horticulture chains) and control groups in the dairy and horticulture chains were offered PBS assistance roughly one year after the treatment group. As over 15,000 individuals had participated in the PBS Activity by August 2012, this evaluation sample of 1,736 individuals (518, 593, and 625 in the dairy, horticulture, and handicrafts chains, respectively) includes only 11 percent of the individuals served under the activity."

More than 45 different pesticides were allowed for use on the lease lands of these refuges, including some potentially toxic organophosphate insecticides (disulfoton and chlorpyrifos), pyrethroids (permethrin and cyfluthrin) and fungicides (chlorothalonil). The following pesticide monitoring study, conducted during the 1998, 1999, and 2000 agricultural seasons was designed to evaluate the acute risks of pesticides used on the refuge, with special emphasis on monitoring at sites where the above pesticides were used. The objectives of this study were (1) to survey both refuges for dead or impaired wildlife, with an emphasis on mortality events in/near agricultural areas, (2) to determine whether pesticide exposure is implicated in any death or impairment discovered, and (3) to investigate the source of any pesticide exposure detected."

Located approximately 10 miles from downtown Denver, the land (15,988 acres) within the boundary of Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge (RMANWR) has a well-documented history of significant environmental disturbance and contamination. The primary causes of degradation were the manufacture of chemical weapons by the U.S. Army from the World War II through Vietnam eras and the production of pesticides by Shell Chemical Company in the 1980's. Given the extent and type of degradation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified the need for these lands to be remediated in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, also commonly known as Superfund) to ensure standards for human health and the environment are met prior to transferring ownership to the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) for management as a National Wildlife Refuge. Remediation activities mandated under CERCLA will result in restoring approximately 67% (10,739 acres) of RMANWR lands to native short- and mixed-grass prairie. Other habitats that will be present on RMANWR include shrublands, forested lands, riparian areas, and numerous manmade features (irrigation lakes, ditches, homesteads, etc.), many of which are of cultural or historic importance. More than 300 species of wildlife have been documented on RMANWR, but many of these species occur in low numbers or are not observed frequently. To identify priority resources of concern, refuge staff compiled a list of species documented as priorities in various plans developed by national, regional, local, state, and private organizations and compared this list to species that currently use, or potentially could use RMANWR habitats. Species that exhibited significant overlap were selected as priority resources of concern and the habitat requirements (e.g., food, cover, area requirements) of these species formed the basis for HMP goals, objectives, and management strategies. However, habitat resources are limited given the size and isolated nature of the refuge; therefore, RMANWR staff used published scientific literature and professional expertise to identify potential conflicts and optimize conditions for these species within the context of BIDEH. Specifically, the goals and objectives of this HMP are designed to accomplish the following during the next 15 years (2013-2028): Promote successful long-term establishment and maintenance of seeded restoration sites, as well as existing native prairies and shrublands, to provide habitat for the resources of concern. Maintain the importance of RMANWR as a priority nesting site for burrowing owls (Athen cunicularia hypugaea) along the Front Range of Colorado. Preserve a historically representative population of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Provide additional nesting opportunities for resources of concern, including relevant grassland-dependent bird species exhibiting population declines. Maintain a bison (Bison bison) population that contributes to the Department of the Interior's Bison Conservation Initiative and helps maintain the structure and composition of native and restored prairies necessary to support priority grassland bird species. Provide habitat in the Educational Zone of the refuge for neo-tropical migratory bird species that are losing suitable stop-over areas to urban development in the Denver-metro area. Provide long-term quality nesting and roosting habitat for the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). As one of the nation's premier urban national wildlife refuges, the RMANWR provides a variety of unique public education opportunities."

In this paper I examine foraging behavior of Piping Plover to determine factors that affect the time plovers devote to foraging. Objectives of the study were to determine: (1) where Piping Plovers foraged, (2) time devoted to foraging as a function of nesting beach, reproductive stage and brood size, and (3) the effect of human activities on foraging time. Piping Plovers are ideal for such an examination because they nest solitarily on barrier beach islands that have suffered from increased human development and recreational activities. I examined foraging behavior because clutch size) and nest sites do not seem to be causing population declines. Thus I wanted to determine whether Piping Plover experienced difficulties foraging because of people. Reproductive success is lower in areas with high human disturbance. Foraging behavior of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) was studied using a focal animal approach from 1985-1986. Time devoted to foraging decreased as vigilance (time devoted to being alert) increased. Variations in vigilance were explained by beach, reproductive stage, brood size, time of day, and number of people nearby. Overall, Piping Plovers foraged from 46-79 sec., were alert for 14-57 sec., and displayed or ran from people for 1-8 sec. in the 2 min. samples. Plovers at sites less disturbed by people (Little Beach, Holgate) generally devoted more time to foraging and less time to vigilance than birds at the other sites. Time devoted to foraging was generally higher In May, lower in June, and increased again in July. Plovers that were incubating or caring for chicks spent less time foraging than those that had lost their chicks. Chicks spent less time foraging and more time being alert, running, and crouching than did their parents foraging during the same time periods. With increasing brood size, chicks spent less time foraging and more time running or crouching although the number of people nearby did not vary. Behavior was correlated within members of a pair: birds spent less time foraging as their mates increased time devoted to alertness, being off the nest, or displaying. When brooding birds increased alert time, their mates increased their alertness and displaying, and decreased foraging time. As the number of people near foraging plovers increased, time devoted to running and crouching increased and time devoted to feeding decreased. It appears that the presence of people is stressful for breeding adults and chicks, forcing them to spend significantly less time foraging, perhaps accounting for decreased overall reproductive success."

A weather record is considered broken if the value exceeds the maximum (or minimum) value recorded for an eligible station. A weather record is considered tied if the value is the same as the maximum (or minimum) value recorded for an eligible station. Daily weather parameters include Highest Min/Max Temperature, Lowest Min/Max Temperature, Highest Precipitation, Highest Snowfall and Highest Snow Depth. All stations meet defined eligibility criteria. For this application, a station is defined as the complete daily weather records at a particular location, having a unique identifier in the GHCN-Daily dataset. For a station to be considered for any weather parameter, it must have a minimum of 30 years of data with more than 182 days complete in each year. This is effectively a 30-year record of service requirement, but allows for inclusion of some stations which routinely shut down during certain seasons. Small station moves, such as a move from one property to an adjacent property, may occur within a station history. However, larger moves, such as a station moving from downtown to the city airport, generally result in the commissioning of a new station identifier. This tool treats each of these histories as a different station. In this way, it does not thread the separate histories into one record for a city. Records Timescales are characterized in three ways. In order of increasing noteworthiness, they are Daily Records, Monthly Records and All Time Records. For a given station, Daily Records refers to the specific calendar day: (e.g., the value recorded on March 7th compared to every other March 7th). Monthly Records exceed all values observed within the specified month (e.g., the value recorded on March 7th compared to all values recorded in every March). All-Time Records exceed the record of all observations, for any date, in a station's period of record. The Date Range and Location features are used to define the time and location ranges which are of interest to the user. For example, selecting a date range of March 1, 2012 through March 15, 2012 will return a list of records broken or tied on those 15 days. The Location Category and Country menus allow the user to define the geographic extent of the records of interest. For example, selecting Oklahoma will narrow the returned list of records to those that occurred in the state of Oklahoma, USA. The number of records broken for several recent periods is summarized in the table and updated daily. Due to late-arriving data, the number of recent records is likely underrepresented in all categories, but the ratio of records (warm to cold, for example) should be a fairly strong estimate of a final outcome. There are many more precipitation stations than temperature stations, so the raw number of precipitation records will likely exceed the number of temperature records in most climatic situations."

Hunters from 13 villages killed polar bears during this period. The documented minimum polar bear harvest for 1980/81 and 1981/82 hunting seasons were 106 and 90, respectively. A minimum of 21 bears were harvested from January 1 to July 30, 1980 (ADF&G records) and have been included in the pooled sample of 217 killed bears. Of this total, 134 (61.8%) were bears for which complete sex and age information was obtained; 52 (23.9%) were bears for which adequate sex and/or age class information was obtained; and 31 (14.3%) were bears known to have been killed for which sex and age information was unknown. The sample of 134 known sex and age bears consisted of 27 percent litter members (cubs, yearlings, or 2-year olds), 31 percent females greater than 3 years of age, and 42 percent males greater than 3 years of age. The sex ratio was 81 (60.4%) males to 53 (39.6%) females. The sex ratio of bears captured from 1967-76 in a tagging study (Lentfer, 1977) was significantly different. The mean age of males and females was 7.3! 4.8 years. Male mean age was 5.8 \u00b1 3.9 years and female was 9.0 \u00b1 5.4 years. A significant inverse relationship was determined for harvested female cubs less than 3 years, female subadults, 4-5 years, and females age 6-10. A significant positive relationship was determined for harvested females 10 years or older, subadult males, and adult males 6 years or older. From January 1980 to April 1982 an average annual removal of 38 females occurred. This figure excluded 31 unknown sex and age bears. If the percentage of adult females of known sex and age bears is applied to the 31 excluded bears then the average annual female removal was 44 bears. Polar bears were harvested during each month of the year except September. Of 197 bears sampled, 123 (62.4%) were harvested during November, December, and January. Forty-five bears (22.8%) were harvested in October and November, primarily in the North Slope villages. Recent harvest chronology differs markedly from that of the sports hunting era when most bears were taken from February through April. Of the 124 hunters who killed 217 polar bear during 1980-82, 37 (29.8%) killed more than one bear; of these, 27 (73.8%) killed more than 2 bears. Snowmachines (89.5%) were the most common hunting transportation form used, small boats (6.8%) ranked second and other means accounted for the remainder of the harvest."

There were 373 adult males, 528 adult females, 405 calves, and 193 of unknown sex. Adult refers to animals older than calves yet not necessarily sexually mature. This was the largest harvest recorded in Gambell in the last 5 years and perhaps in recent history. Several factors influenced the high harvest. The last two of three strikes on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) was lost 26 April and walrus hunting commenced 29 April. Although this was 2 weeks earlier than the walrus hunt in 1983 (Sease 1983), it was a week or more later than the bunts in 1982 (Malloy 1982) and 1981 (Lourie 1981). However, not catching a whale certainly motivated the hunters to bring in more walrus meat. There were 26 days during the 1984 monitoring period when walrus were captured as opposed to 20 days in 1983 and 19 days in 1982. Ice and wind conditions were such that hunters had greater access to walrus than the previous three years. During the 1982 and 1983 monitoring periods, there were only two days each year on which more than 100 walrus were retrieved. During the 1984 monitoring session, the catch exceeded 100 walrus on six days (Table 2). The hunters were reporting large herds and good ice conditions. Small amounts of ice persisted until 1 June which was the last day 15 or more walrus were retrieved. The shore ice on the north beach held fast until 2 June. It seemed that thick ice capable of supporting walrus persisted a week longer in 1984 than the previous 3 seasons. Proportionately more females and calves were caught during the 1984 monitoring session than during 1981 (chi-square 16.34, 2 df) or during 1983 (chi-square 23.48, 2 df, Table 3). More male walrus were taken than expected during the 1984 season when compared to 1982 (chi-square 8.23, 2 df). The distribution of hunting days relative to the walrus migration probably explains the differences in sex composition between years. There were fewer hunting days at the end of May and the beginning of June during 1982 than 1983 or 1984 (Malloy 1982, Sease 1983). This year there were more hunting days in April and early May than during 1983. Female and calf walrus are the first to migrate and tend to stay with thicker ice (Fay 1982). Male walrus migrate later and were taken in greater numbers by Gambell hunters during the end of May and beginning of June. Female and calf walrus are preferred for their meat in Gambell and are taken in large numbers early in the hunting season."

To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.

What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Data were collected from May 1998 to September 2000 to further characterize streamflow and surface-water and bottom-sediment quality in the lower Humboldt River, selected agricultural drains. Upper Humboldt Lake, and Lower Humboldt Drain (ephemeral outflow from Humboldt Sink). During this study, flow in the lower Humboldt River was either at or above average. Flows in Army and Toulon Drains generally were higher than reported in previous investigations. An unnamed agricultural drain contributed a small amount to the flow measured in Army Drain. In general, measured concentrations of sodium, chloride, dissolved solids, arsenic, boron, molybdenum, and uranium were higher in water from agricultural drains than in Humboldt River water during this study. Mercury concentrations in water samples collected during the study period typically were below the laboratory reporting level. Although water supplies from the agricultural drains typically contained higher concentrations of sodium, chloride, dissolved solids, arsenic, boron, and uranium, greater instantaneous loads of these constituents were carried in the river near Lovelock than in agricultural drains during periods of high flow or non-irrigation. Nickel concentrations in sediments collected during this study were above the consensus-based threshold-effect concentration. All other river and drain sediments had constituent concentrations below protective criteria and toxicity thresholds. In Upper Humboldt Lake, chloride, dissolved solids, arsenic, boron, molybdenum, and uranium concentrations in surface-water samples collected near the mouth of the Humboldt River generally were higher than in samples collected near the mouth of Army Drain. Ecological criteria of effect concentrations for chloride, arsenic, boron, molybdenum, and selenium were exceeded in samples collected near the mouths of the Humboldt River and Army Drain. Bottom sediments collected from Upper Humboldt Lake had arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, and nickel concentrations that either approached or exceeded biological-effect concentrations and/or Canadian Interim Freshwater Sediment-Quality Guidelines. All other wetland sediments collected during this study had constituent concentrations within acceptable limits."

This sequence of rocks has a cumulative thickness of about 14,000 m, but most localities contain no more than 7,000-8,000 m. Locally the section is much thinner where units are missing through erosion or nondeposition. The sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age and older are divided into 23 formations, several of which are further subdivided into mappable members. Some of the stratigraphic units are newly named, and several others have been geographically extended from adjoining areas. Many formations are revised either in age or with regard to the positions of their contacts. Paleozoic rocks are known definitely from only one locality, a small islet at theentrance to Puale Bay. About 40 m of mid- Permian limestone are exposed on this islet. Isolated outcrops of metamorphic rocks are preserved as roof pendants in the Alaska- Aleutian Range batholith northeast of Becharof Lake, and their protoliths may have been, in part, of Permian age, but the lithology indicates that their protoliths were more likely of Triassic or Early Jurassic age. The Mesozoic sequence ranges in age from Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous and has a maximum thickness of about 8,500 m. In ascending stratigraphic order, the units consist of the Kamishak Formation (Upper Triassic), Talkeetna Formation (Lower Jurassic), Kialagvik Formation (Lower and Middle Jurassic), Shelikof Formation (Middle Jurassic), Naknek Formation (Upper Jurassic), herein-revised Staniukovich Formation (Lower Cretaceous), herein-redefined Herendeen Formation (Lower Cretaceous), Pedmar Formation (new) (Lower Cretaceous), herein-redescribed Chignik Formation (Upper Cretaceous), Hoodoo Formation (Upper Cretaceous), Shumagin Formation (Upper Cretaceous), and Kaguyak Formation (Upper Cretaceous). Additionally, the Naknek Formation is subdivided into five members.

While previous MCC programs on reducing corruption in public procurement have been implemented in Paraguay, Uganda, and Kenya, generating interest in the potential of these programs to achieve results more broadly, these three prior programs have been threshold programs and relatively smaller in magnitude than the $50 million procurement modernization component of the Indonesia Compact. The Indonesia Procurement Modernization project is the first to try to achieve results broadly and at a national scale. The impacts of the Indonesia PM project evaluation may have implications for the design of future MCC programs, and with broader dissemination of its findings, may influence other donors as well. Although existing quantitative evidence on the introduction of e-procurement suggests that procedural and other reforms may improve procurement outcomes (Lewis-Faupel et al., forthcoming), there is little quantitative evidence on more- comprehensive reforms, and the MCC Procurement Modernization project evaluation seeks to fill this space with new and more compelling evidence. While we are not able to measure effects on economic growth as a result of the program directly, if the program is found to have strong effects on cost savings and procurement performance, a follow-on effect on economic growth may be plausible."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

                "text": "Lesotho - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), through its Compact with the government of Lesotho (GoL), awarded $164-million over five years for investment in improved water supplies and sanitation facilities for rural and urban domestic, commercial, and industrial users. As part of its commitment to transparently and thoroughly monitor and evaluate its activities, the MCC contracted NORC in 2007 to conduct an impact evaluation of its water sector activities. This report presents the Impact Evaluation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Activity (RWSSA).   RWSSA originally included 250 rural water supply points and 10,000 VIP latrines and had a budget of $30.2 million (18 percent of the $164-million Water Project in the Compact). In order to increase the coverage of VIP latrines in participating villages, MCC subsequently increased the budget to $40.1 million and the Government of Lesotho (GOL) contributed $17.1 million to RWSSA. In addition, the target for VIP latrines coverage was increased from 10,000 to 27,245 in the Lesotho M&E Plan.  When the Lesotho Compact ended in September 2013, 175 water systems (70% of the target) and 29,352 VIP latrines (108% of the target) had been installed.  Implementation continued post-Compact with approximately $5.3 million of additional funding from the GOL; ultimately, 250 water systems (100% of the target), and 31,768 VIP latrines (117% of the revised target), were completed. The total cost of RWSSA, including MCC and GOL funding during the Compact and after, was approximately $60 million.  Households impacted by the program are located in villages that were identified by the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) as lacking access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. To identify the effects of the program on the outcomes of interest, eligible villages were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The list of outcomes analyzed includes toilet use, type of water source used, time spent collecting water, diarrhea incidence and income, among others.   To evaluate the impact of the program we use data from the baseline and follow-up Impact Evaluation Multipurpose Surveys (IEMS). The IEMS is a longitudinal analytic survey specifically designed to collect data for the impact evaluations of the MCA-Lesotho Compact health and water (rural and urban) activities.  The baseline version of the survey included items on basic sociodemographics, household access to water and sanitation, water consumption, hygiene and health profiles. The follow-up version of the survey added a few labor outcome items to the instrument.  During program implementation construction delays in some treatment villages meant that construction works ended after follow-up data collection. As a consequence, randomization was compromised because the villages that were actually treated before follow-up data collection were a subset of the villages that were assigned to the treatment group originally. To tackle this problem the evaluation used Instrumental Variables (IV) methods in order to evaluate the effect of the program. This approach exploits the fact that treatment assignment was randomized, but it also addresses the fact that treatment was not provided as planned in all treatment villages.   The impact evaluation shows that the program has had significant effects on key wellbeing indicators. It found that households in the treatment group are more likely than in the control group to use as their main water source an improved water source, such as a public standpipe or a protected spring, as opposed to an unimproved source, such as an unprotected spring or surface water. They are also more likely to use a toilet and spend less time collecting water. However, the evaluation did not find any impacts significant at standard levels of confidence for any of the diarrhea incidence indicators analyzed, although most of the estimated effects have the (negative) expected sign.   The evaluation also did not find any effects for any labor outcomes, or income. An important exception to this is that it found that the program has a positive and significant effect on female labor participation. The evaluation discusses the mechanisms that can explain why the effects on labor outcomes are not more apparent. In particular, it is possible that time availability does not translate into better labor outcomes because the latter are not restricted by time availability but by other conditions, like the labor market itself.  In terms of policy implications, the results described in this report imply that this type of program can have major impacts on households wellbeing via reductions on time spent collecting water, but limited effects on higher level outcomes, like diarrhea incidence. Furthermore, even if household members spend less time collecting water as a result of the program, it is not clear that this will translate into a 1:1 increase in the number of hours they participate in the labor market, as labor outcomes may depend on more factors than just greater available time."

To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

Did trainees enroll in PICG-supported courses and graduate from them at targeted levels?          What were the labor market outcomes (employment and wages) for graduates from PICG-supported courses?          What were employer perceptions of the graduates from the PICG-supported courses, and how did the availability of these graduates affect their hiring and training plans?          Will PICG-supported courses be sustained after the compact?         What are TVET providers' perceptions of the best practices identified and disseminated by the project, to what extent have they adopted them, and what are the main barriers to doing so?         To what extent have the MES and its agencies adopted the policy reforms supported by the project, and what have been the main challenges in doing so?          How and to what extent has the annual TVET conference influenced providers, employers, the MES, and other TVET sector stakeholders?     To answer these questions, we propose a mixed-methods performance evaluation, which will include two studies: (1) a quantitative outcomes study of Activity 1; and (2) a qualitative study assessing all project activities (Activities 1-4). To evaluate the possible effects of Activity 1, the outcomes study will measure the training and labor market outcomes of trainees in PICG-supported courses approximately one year after they graduate and, to the extent possible, compare those outcomes with those of a relevant sample of trainees who attended non-supported courses. The qualitative study will explore implementation of all the project activities, the potential mechanisms driving the results observed in the Activity 1 outcomes study, and the likelihood of sustainability across all ISWD initiatives after the compact ends."

                "text": "El Salvador - Formal Technical Education With a budget of nearly $20 million, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was designed to strengthen technical and vocational educational institutions in the Northern Zone of El Salvador. By improving schools and offering scholarships, the sub-activity financed efforts to increase youths' access to high-quality technical education in the region, thus increasing their achievement levels, secondary (and post-secondary) school graduation rates, and prospects for gainful employment. By 2012, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was scheduled to invest $3.8 million in scholarships for students enrolled in secondary and post-secondary technical schools in the Northern Zone. According to preliminary budgets, the sub-activity would also provide $9 million to improve 20 technical secondary schools in the Northern Zone with infrastructure investments and additional teacher training programs. In addition, the sub-activity was scheduled to invest $7 million to strengthen ITCHA, an existing post-secondary institute in the Northern Zone.   In conducting the evaluation of the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity-which includes secondary and post-secondary school improvements and scholarships-Mathematica will address the following research questions regarding Sub-Activity investments from 2009 to 2012:   1.Program design/implementation. How were the secondary school strengthening and scholarship programs, and the ITCHA strengthening program designed and implemented? Did implementation meet original targets and expectations? Why or why not?  2.Description of participants. What are the characteristics (age, gender, initial household income, etc.) of scholarship recipients? What are the basic characteristics of secondary school and ITCHA students?   3.Impact/Results. What is the impact of FOMILENIO's strengthening secondary school program on students' education and labor market outcomes, including secondary school enrollment, grade completion, graduation, and further education, employment, and income? What is the impact of the offer of scholarships in some programs within strengthened schools on student educational and labor outcomes? Did ITCHA graduates obtain jobs and experience increased income following graduation? Did ITCHA students who graduated from secondary school MEGATEC programs have better academic and labor market outcomes than students who did not attend secondary school MEGATEC programs?  4.Impacts/Results by key target subgroups. Were impacts/results different for girls versus boys? What types of participants experienced positive impacts?  5.Explanation for impact findings and results. What was the ex-post statistical power, and can this explain the lack of impacts (in cases where no impacts are found)? What aspects of implementation could explain the impacts/results? If impacts/results were different for girls versus boys, why?  6.Sustainability. Are secondary school improvements and scholarships being maintained? Are ITCHA improvements being maintained? Are they likely to be maintained in the medium to long term?   To answer all research questions regarding the design, implementation, and sustainability of the strengthening efforts and scholarships (Topics 1, 2, 5, and 6), Matheatica will use a mixed-methods evaluation design that uses qualitative and quantitative methods (see Table III.1). With this approach, researchers will use qualitative methods-namely, qualitative interview data and programmatic reports-to help understand processes and activities, provide information on setting or context, and communicate the perspectives and experiences of key participants through direct quotes. In addition, Mathematica will use quantitative information on program outputs and costs, participant characteristics, and budget outlays to summarize the intervention, describe its participants, and analyze the sustainability of its original investments.   To answer research questions regarding impacts and results (3, 4, and 5), Mathematica will use a variety of designs. To determine the impact of secondary school scholarships, researchers designed and implemented a random assignment design, by which some eligible applicants were randomly selected to receive scholarships. To determine the impact of secondary school strengthening investments, Mathematica designed and implemented a matched comparison group approach using propensity score methods, by which students at the 20 strengthened schools are compared to students at 20 similar non-strengthened schools. Finally, to measure key results of the ITCHA intervention-including graduation and employment rates-researchers used a mixed-methods approach that featured a follow-up survey of ITCHA students.   All impact and results analyses rely on in-person surveys, including panel surveys of scholarship applicants, cross-sectional baseline and follow-up surveys of secondary school students, and a follow-up survey of ITCHA students."

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).    Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Causes of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

The EEDSM Project consists of four activities: the Development and Enforcement of Standards and Labels activity, the Improved Energy Auditing activity, the Education and Public Information activity, and the Demand Side Management activity.   The evaluation of the EEDSM project will address the following questions for each of the four interventions designed to reduce energy waste and increase the reserve margin between electricity supply and peak demand. These interventions include (1) a rollout of energy efficiency standards, (2) implementation of the pre-tertiary school curriculum and public information on use of efficient appliances with standards and labels via different media platforms, (3) implementation of an energy auditing and retrofitting activity and an intervention to establish two sustainable energy services centers (SESCs) that will train and certify energy auditors for the country, and (4) installing energy-efficient LED street lights. The methodological approach for the performance evaluation of EEDSM relies in tracking key outcomes over time, qualitative data analysis, pre-post analysis, and simulations. The impact evaluation will assess the impact of the R2R&R intervention on the electricity consumption. We will measure impacts relative to the pre-treatment period using an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) method which involves comparing outcomes before an intervention is implemented with those after. The sample for the analysis of outcomes from administrative utility data will include the intervention buildings.   Evaluation questions include: 1. Have the EEDSM interventions changed consumption of electricity by individual customers? 2. Did the availability and purchases of more energy-efficient appliances increase when standards were implemented? To what extent can these changes be attributed to the new standards? 3. To what extent has the R2R&R intervention affected electricity use and bill payment rates? 4. Were project activities implemented as designed? How did implementation (in terms of objectives, activities, and beneficiaries) deviate from the original logic driving the investment, and why? How did changes in implementation affect project performance? What were the implementation successes and challenges? 5. Were improvements in project outcomes sustained after the end of the compact?

Degradation's in capacitor and MOSFET components are often the cause of failures in DC-DC converters. For example, prevalent fault effects, such as a ripple voltage surge at the power supply output, can damage interconnected critical subsystems leading to cascading fault propagation. Prognostics in general and in this case electronics components in particular is concerned with the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of components and systems. It performs a condition-based health assessment by estimating the current state of health. Furthermore, it leverages the knowledge of the device physics and degradation physics to predict remaining useful life as a function of current state of health and anticipated operational and environmental conditions. Physics-based models capture degradation phenomena in terms of component geometry and energy based principles that define the effect of stressors on the component behavior. This is in contrast to the traditional approach for deriving degradation models from empirical data. Implementing the degradation  modeling techniques    present a general methodology for estimating lifetimes due to specific failure mechanisms. The failure    rate models can be tuned to include parameters that relate to the present health of the device/system and the    expected conditions under which it will be operated.

Health state estimation is based on actual conditions and it is fundamental for the prediction of RUL under anticipated future usage. Failure of electronic devices is of great concern as future aircraft will see an increase of electronics to drive and control safety-critical equipment throughout the aircraft. Therefore, development of prognostics solutions for electronics is of key importance. This paper presents an accelerated aging system for gate-controlled power transistors. This system allows for the understanding of the effects of failure mechanisms, and the identification of leading indicators of failure which are essential in the development of physics-based degradation models and RUL prediction. In particular, this system isolates electrical overstress from thermal overstress. Also, this system allows for a precise control of internal temperatures, enabling the exploration of intrinsic failure mechanisms not related to the device packaging. By controlling the temperature within safe operation levels of the device, accelerated aging is induced by electrical overstress only, avoiding the generation of thermal cycles. The temperature is controlled by active thermal-electric units. Several electrical and thermal signals are measured in-situ and recorded for further analysis in the identification of leading indicators of failures. This system, therefore, provides a unique capability in the exploration of different failure mechanisms and the identification of precursors of failure that can be used to provide a health management solution for electronic devices."

Because the new electric lines will come from the existing power grid, an experimental design is not feasible for the overall impact evaluation. Therefore, the evaluators will combine two parallel approaches. The first approach to evaluate the overall impact of the project will use a non-experimental design taking advantage of the timeline of the rollout of the project and using propensity score matching to identify treatment (households that receive the new electrical service) and control groups (households that do not receive new service). Using specialized household surveys for both the household head and his/her spouse and with an intra-household time allocation module, the evaluators will estimate the differences in energy consumption, household income, and time use between the treatment and control groups. A difference-in-difference estimation method will control for changes in non-observable variables, and instrumental variables estimation will control for any remaining potential sources of selection bias.  The second approach will focus on the first set of households to be connected to the electricity grid, i.e. a subsample of towns and households from the full sample being evaluated. From this sub-sample of households we will select randomly an additional control and treatment group. The treatment group will be randomly assigned vouchers for 20% and 50% of the cost of the installation of the connection that the households/business will need to pay in order access the electricity once the cable reaches their household/business (the average cost is around 120 US$).

Change in ON-state resistance is used as a precursor of failure due to its dependence on junction temperature. The experimental data is augmented with a finite element analysis simulation that is based on a two-transistor model. The simulation assists in the interpretation of the degradation phenomena and SOA (safe operation area) change."

Plug loads are expected to account for a    significant portion of overall energy consumption because building    design choices resulted in greatly reduced energy demand    from Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and    lighting systems, which are typically major contributors to energy    consumption in traditional buildings.

Findings indicate that choosing energy efficient equipment,    ensuring that power saving functionality is operating effectively,    promoting beneficial occupant energy behavior, and employing    plug load controls to turn off equipment when not in use can    lead to significant energy savings.

Introduction    The Human Capital Project is one of three projects under the second compact, and it focuses on improving the quality of education and achieving a better match between the supply of skills and the demands of the labor market as they pertain to the international trade of goods and services in El Salvador. The Human Capital Project consists of two activities: (1) the Education Quality Activity, which is intended to improve the quality of the national education system; and (2) the Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) System Reform Activity. The TVET System Reform Activity, with funding of nearly $15 million, is intended to enhance its capacity to harmonize the skills supplied through education and training providers with the skills demanded by the labor market.     MCC contracted with Mathematica to conduct an evaluation of the activities under the Human Capital Project, including the TVET System Reform Activity. Mathematica will conduct a performance evaluation of the TVET System Reform Activity to document its implementation and assess how successful the project was at achieving the intended outcomes. Lessons learned through this performance evaluation will be useful for stakeholders as they continue improving the TVET system, and to inform decisions about the potential expansion of the reform activities to other sectors beyond the sectors focalized by FOMILENIO II.  II. Overview of the Technical  Education and Professional Training System  (TEPT) Activity The revised implementation of this Activity encompasses two main sub activities:     1. Integrated Technical Education and Professional Training Systems Sub-Activity: The revised implementation plan for this sub-activity includes two strategies:         a. Capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. The capacity building strategy has two goals: the first is to enable the private and public sector to identify and manage demands for technical education and professional training. The second is to enable public sector stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of education and training programs to respond quickly and efficiently to private sector labor market demands.     b. Strengthen the link between the supply and demand of technical education and professional training  through the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of information within and between productive sectors , and between private and public institutions in all productive sectors. FOMILENIO II will support the development of sectoral diagnostics to identify the needs of the productive sector, and improve the match between the industries and the training offerings in specified geographic areas. The following are the main tasks for implementing this strategy: 1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; 2) design or update three optional modules of the BTVs with input from the Sectoral Committees; and 3) Establish agreements between companies from the productive sectors and MINED to offer internships for students.    2. Continuous Labor Demand Assessment Sub-Activity. Two strategies encompass the implementation of this sub-activity: 1) establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework; and 2) strengthen the labor market observatory, integrating existing efforts to track labor market conditions.  III. Logic Model    The TEPT Activity in El Salvador is designed to link activities in the systems of technical education and professional training to the needs of the labor market in order to close the gap between training and employment. To that end, TEPT activities are largely focused on facilitating the exchange of information between the supply side and the demand side, both within and between productive sectors. The theory of change behind the implementation of the TEPT Activity states that all of its outputs will increase companies' productivity, and thereby improve workers' wages as well as the employability and socioeconomic standing of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.    1. Activities    The TEPT Activity funded by FOMILENIO II aims to strengthen capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. To that end, this strategy includes (1) creating sectoral committees for technical and educational training, and creating a Sectoral Committee Board to consolidate the demand for professional development in the private sector; (2) offering professional training to workers in the different industrial sectors under the competency-based approach; (3) designing models for certifying workers by competencies and accrediting institutions; (4) creating a Coordination Council of Technical Education and Professional Training to facilitate coordination between public and private organizations involved in technical and professional training, and align the offerings to the skills demanded in the labor market; and (5) establishing procedures and regulations to strengthen the institutional capacity to meet the private sector's demand for technical education and professional training. Implementation of the TEPT Activity includes the design of a roadmap for creating a national qualifications framework, and the development of an information system for the Coordination Council and other bodies to use in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the TEPT Activity.    The TEPT activity also seeks to improve the link between labor demand in the productive sectors with the availability of technical education and vocational training. To achieve this goal, FOMILENIO II plans to: (1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; (2) design at least three modules for the Vocational Technical Baccalaureate in coordination with the Sectoral Committees; and (3) establish agreements between companies from the sectors and MINEDUCYT to offer internships for students.     2. Short- and medium-term outcomes    Once the sectoral committees and the Board of Sectoral Committees are in existence, and a model for certification and accreditation has been implemented, the private sector will improve its capacity to identify and influence the professional training that is available to prospective trainees. Designing modules for the Professional Technical Baccalaureate, and creating the Coordination Council of TEPT will also improve the linkage between the demands of the productive sector, and the availability of technical education and vocational training.     3. Long-term outcomes    In the long term, the TEPT Activity is expected to improve the government's capacity to plan and evaluate the offer of technical education and professional training assisted by the MNC and the information system developed for subsequent planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the improved match between labor demand in the industrial/private sectors and the technical training available to the potential workforce will improve the productivity of companies, and therefore increase workers' wages. It is also expected to improve the employability of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.  IV. Evaluation design    The aims of the performance evaluation are to (1) assess progress toward the short- and medium-term outcomes that the program was designed to achieve and (2) understand and document the implementation of the Technical Education and Professional Training activities. To meet these two overarching aims, the performance evaluation will include a pre-post analysis of program outcomes and an implementation study.    A. Pre-post design.    The single group pre-post design consists of obtaining data for the outcomes of interest prior to (or at the beginning of) TEPT training (pre) and the same measure after participation in the TEPT courses (post). The pre-post study will focus on measuring the changes on labor market outcomes, and assessing to what extent work conditions, wages, and employment status improved for those who participated in the TEPT programs.     B. Implementation study     The implementation study will focus on describing all components of the TEPT program and their operation and identifying progress towards short- and medium-term outcomes of the program. We will document how program components were implemented, explore the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation of TEPT sub-activities, and describe the main program outputs of the TEPT System. We will also identify short- and long-term achievements and sustainability efforts related to each TEPT sub-activity.  V. Evaluation research questions    The pre-post study will focus on three descriptive research questions:    1. Did employee work conditions, benefits or non-wage compensation, change for trainees who participated in the TEPT courses approximately six to nine months after the courses ended?     2. Did wages change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    3. Did employment status change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    We will examine five main overarching research questions through the implementation study:    1. How were the TEPT sub-activities implemented, and what were the major facilitators and barriers to implementation?    2. Were some sectors more successful implementing the TEPT activities than others?    3. Which outputs were accomplished for each sub-activity, and to what extent did they meet the targets?     4. Which short- and long-term outcomes were accomplished for each sub-activity?     5. What are the plans for the institutional and financial sustainability of the services offered and the entities created as part of the TEPT activity?  VI. Data sources and analysis plan    A. Pre-post study:     Data sources.     The primary data source for the performance evaluation will be the trainee tracer survey. In collaboration with FOMILENIO II, we will field the pre-training tracer survey (baseline) with about 500 participants who are enrolled in TEPT courses, either prior to or within one month of their course initiation. TEPT courses will be rolled out starting the second quarter of 2019. Because the timing for the rollout will vary, baseline data collection will take place on a rolling basis and will be aligned with the course rollout plan for the prioritized sectors. We plan to conduct the baseline survey as a Computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ) with groups of enrolled trainees at their training sites and the follow-up survey as an individual, face-to-face, computer-administered questionnaire at respondents' work sites or homes. We will collect the follow-up survey six to nine months after the course ends by following a staggered timeline similar to the baseline data collection. The follow-up survey is expected to start in mid-2020 and to extend beyond the compact period.     Analyses.     To assess changes in work conditions, wages, and employment status sometime after participants should have completed the TEPT training programs, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the tracer survey data for trainees in FOMILENIO II-supported courses. We will compare key outcome indicators at baseline and follow-up for each trainee-level outcome and report averages (mean percent change) for the full sample of trainees and also by gender. We will also describe the background trainee characteristics, such as gender, age, and education level. The analysis will include a cross-sector comparison of participant characteristics and implementation milestones.    B. Implementation study    Data sources.     We will draw on three sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on outputs and achievements of the TEPT activity: (1) stakeholder interviews, (2) program monitoring data, and (3) a document review.     Analyses.     a. Analytic approach for quantitative program implementation data. We will conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on monitoring data to summarize the program outputs and understand short-term and long-term program achievements.    b. Analytic approach for qualitative program implementation data. We will prepare interview and focus group transcripts and conduct thematic analysis in two sequential steps. The first step involves conducting data reduction and mapping transcript segments to the core performance research questions. The second step involves thematic framing-the process of distilling themes and identifying patterns in qualitative data. We will develop a coding framework with a hierarchy of conceptual categories that are linked to the research questions and the program logic model. We will also create thematic memos for data synthesis and interpretation of key findings.     To take advantage of the complementarity that a mixed-methods approach affords, we will integrate findings from descriptive quantitative analysis of monitoring and administrative data with findings from qualitative data sources. We will summarize program outputs and outcomes from FOMILENIO II's administrative records and implementation reports by using data abstraction templates that we will design for this study. We will also create summary tables of qualitative findings from key stakeholder interviews. Then, we will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings by using triangulation techniques to (1) assess the consistency of the findings across methods and data sources, (2) confirm patterns of findings, and (3) identify potential discrepancies across data sources. Furthermore, information from the qualitative data collection related to barriers and facilitators to program implementation will help us interpret the findings from the quantitative analysis."

RAJADAS, AND CLYDE COELHO  Abstract. Fatigue damage and its prediction is one of the foremost concerns of structural integrity    research community. The current research in structural health monitoring (SHM) is to    provide continuous (or on demand) information about the state of a structure. The SHM system    can be based on either active or passive sensor measurements. Though the current research on    ultrasonic wave propagation based active sensing approach has the potential to estimate very small    damage, it has severe drawbacks in terms of low sensing radius and external power requirements.    To alleviate these disadvantages passive sensing based SHM techniques can be used. Currently,    few efforts have been made towards, time-series fatigue damage state estimation over the entire    fatigue life (stage-I, II & III). A majority of the available literature on passive sensing SHM techniques    demonstrates the clear trend in damage growth during the final failure regime (stage-III    regime) or during when the damage is comparatively large enough. The present paper proposes a    passive sensing technique that demonstrates a clear trend in damage growth almost over the entire    stage-II and III damage growth regime. A strain gauge measurement based passive SHM frameworks    that can estimate the time-series fatigue damage state under random loading is proposed.    For this purpose, a Bayesian Gaussian process nonlinear dynamic model is developed to map the    reference condition dynamic strain at a given instant of time. The predicted strains are compared    with the actual sensor measurements to estimate the corresponding error signals. The error signals    estimated at two different locations are correlated to estimate the corresponding fatigue damage    state. The approach is demonstrated for an Al-2434 complex cruciform structure applied with    biaxial random loading."

                "text": "Great Smoky Mountains National Park Brook Trout Genetics Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) is committed to monitoring ecological and evolutionary functions and processes of park ecosystems. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only salmonid native to the Southern Appalachians and functions as a keystone species in some headwater streams. The historic use of hatchery-reared brook trout for supplemental and restorative stocking in GRSM underscores the need to recognize the evolutionary relationship among stream populations. A recent survey of microsatellite DNA variation in GRSM brook trout indicated the presence of highly significant differentiation at all hierarical levels which suggests that the individual stream should be considered the unit of management. Given that management resources are limited and that stream-specific management is often not practical, fisheries managers need to know whether the genetic divergence observed among GRSM brook trout reflect adaptive differences or is the variation due to stochastic processes like random genetic drift. DNA microarrays are a powerful method for the global analysis of steady-state intracellular mRNA levels, and thus identifying genes that are transcriptionally modulated as a consequence of metabolic or bioenergetic demands. The information gathered from these arrays of gene sequences can be used to characterize complex biological processes and interactions providing insight into the adaptive significance of observed genetic differentiation. This research objective, if funded, would represent the first attempt at determining whether GRSM fisheries managers should focus their resources on genetic relatedness or demographics.Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only trout native to the Southern Appalachians. Since the turn of the century, this native trout has lost approximately 75 percent of its range in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) (Kelly et al. 1980). Initial range loss (about 50 percent) has been attributed to logging and resultant water quality degradation (King 1937). This activity virtually eliminated brook trout in streams below about 914 m (3,000 ft) in elevation. In turn, residents and loggers became concerned because they had nothing for which to fish. To meet the demand for recreational angling at the time (around 1910), logging companies began stocking both non-native rainbow trout and northern brook trout and continued this activity until the Park was established in 1934. The Park continued to allow the stocking of both species until 1974.Park staff in the 1930s and 1940s saw no harm in stocking rainbows and believed that as reforestation occurred, brook trout would reclaim lost range (King, personal communication). However, distribution surveys in the 1970s showed this not to be true and that 45 percent of the range exclusively occupied by brook trout had been lost since the mid-1930s (Kelly et al. 1980). The decline in allopatric brook trout range was the direct result of rainbow trout encroachment into previously unstocked brook trout streams (Larson and Moore 1985). Native brook trout had become restricted to marginal headwater streams above 1,067 m (3,500 ft), characterized by steep gradients and pH that is naturally slightly acidic. Based on the report by Kelly et al. (1980) it was determined that the only places brook trout could not be displaced are in streams above waterfalls where rainbows could not ascend.Historically, local residents were very vocal about introduced northern strains of brook trout being different from the native brook trout or \"speckled trout.\" Studies in the 1950s showed that physical differences do exist between Southern Appalachian brook trout and hatchery fish. In 1993, a study conducted by the University of Tennessee provided conclusive evidence that Southern Appalachian brook trout are genetically distinct at the subspecies level from northern populations (McCracken et al. 1993). This effort collected brook trout from 47 streams across the Park and dem"

These data support an on-going project and are published online to support project operational needs. As such, these data are not considered valid or final and may contain omissions or errors. Background and HistoryThe brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only trout native to the southern Appalachian Mountains. It was once widespread in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), occupying small, swift, high elevation mountain streams as well as larger rivers down to elevations of 1,600 feet. Since 1900, the brook trout has vanished from about 75% of its historical range in GRSM. The initial loss was due to large-scale mechanized logging operations early in the 20th century. Clear cuts and subsequent fires on steep mountainsides led to soil run-off and stream siltation. In addition, trees were cut from stream banks, allowing more sunlight to reach the waterways and raising water temperatures. The brook trout is even less tolerant of warm water than other trout species- it can not survive temperatures above 68\u02daF. (20\u02daC).As a result of these environmental changes, the brook trout disappeared from all streams in the Smokies below elevations of 3,000 feet. The decline of the brook trout caused displeasure among anglers who longed to trout fish in the mountains. In response, around 1910, logging companies and other entities began stocking streams with non-native rainbow trout from the western United States, brown trout from Europe, and brook trout from the northern United States. Stocking of northern brook trout continued into the 1950s; rainbow trout stocking did not cease until 1975. Competition from the non-native trout, especially rainbows, lead to further declines in the brook trout population. Rainbow trout are larger, more aggressive fish which dominate the prime habitats in streams and eat small brook trout. Biologists believe brook trout range in the Smokies has declined dramatically due to rainbow competition. Most surviving brook trout have become confined to marginal streams above 3,500 feet in elevation.Stream acidification is an increasingly serious threat to the survival of brook trout. Streams in GRSM naturally become more acidic at higher elevations. However, research shows that areas in the park above 4,800 feet in elevation are receiving some of the highest amounts of acid rain, acid fog, and dry deposition of any monitored site in North America. Consequently, many high elevation streams are becoming increasingly acidic, some to the point that they can no longer support brook trout.In 1996, genetic research conducted by the University of Tennessee confirmed long-held beliefs that the southern Appalachian brook trout is a distinct subspecies, differing in several ways from the stocked fish native to the northeastern United States and Canada. Only about 15% of park streams are believed to harbor pure strains of truly native fish, undiluted by hybridization with northern brook trout. Since the southern subspecies has such a limited range, and because that range has been diminished drastically in the last 100 years, the southern brook trout is considered a species of special concern. The Park Service is especially watchful of acidification and competition from rainbow trout in streams where the subspecies currently survives. Why Monitor Distribution?It has been determined that native brook trout have lost approximately 75% of their range and that 30 s"

Television, newspapers and magazines bombard us with these challenging and alarming words. We hear how we have to diversify our economy. We hear that we must find new specialized niches for Alaskan businesses. We hear how we must change to meet today's challenges with tomorrow's skills. Within the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station and the School of Agriculture and Land Resources Management, we've listened to these prophecies. Only we heard them and started addressing them more than a decade ago. We listened when they were only whispers. We did so that we could respond when the whispers became issues needing answers. Just look at the diversity of articles in this issue of Agroborealis and see how we've responded over the years. And then take a few minutes and review the list of publications in the back. Notice the diversity of topics explored. See how so many of them answer some of the questions we ask today. Significantly, many of these publications report studies initiated three, five or more years ago. Reporting findings from our studies continues to be one of the most important responsibilities of our researchers. But research takes time. That's why today, we're still listening to whispers. And from those whispers, we plan our research programs to have answers in 1996 or 1997 or even 2006. With our talented staff and faculty, we'll continue to explore Alaska's many diverse opportunities and problems in natural resources management, agriculture and forestry. This issue of Agroborealis illustrates research in projects ranging from reindeer to arctic tundra rehabilitation. In closing I'd like to thank both ARCO Alaska, Inc. and BP Exploration (Alaska) for their generous grants to underwrite the costs of color photography in Arctic Tundra Rehabilitation-Observations of Progress and Benefits to Alaska. The article, begins on page 29. This summer, the companies will be giving reprints of the article to Prudhoe Bay visitors. Incidentally, Dr. McKendrick started his work on the North Slope in 1972. We'd also like you to know that this issue of Agroborealis is printed on recycled paper. That's another of our responses to the world's changes."

In combination, these components will address the key research questions for the evaluation. The components consist of the following:     A trend analysis, which will examine changes in key outcomes over time using secondary data. These data will largely consist of annual island-level information (covering all four targeted islands and, for some outcomes, additional non-targeted islands) drawn from surveys conducted by other entities, LMITs, or administrative data.     A qualitative study, which will provide rich information to interpret the findings from the trend analysis and enable us to answer a broader set of research questions. The qualitative study will rely on data collected through two rounds of in-depth interviews with key stakeholders at the national and island levels, and one round of focus group discussions with beneficiary households and businesses on targeted islands. Whereas the in-depth interviews will cover all four targeted islands (and, for some stakeholders, additional non-targeted islands), we plan to conduct the focus group discussions primarily on Sal and Boa Vista, the two targeted islands on which implementation will reach the most households and on which we expect to be able to identify all the key household typologies of interest. However, we will also consider conducting some focus groups on additional targeted islands, depending on the final status of implementation and data collection costs.     3.

Unit 9 has traditionally been known as a high nest production unit for waterfowl (ref.1) and requires less intense habitat maintenance, compared to other units, due to the unit\u2019s ability to recycle nutrients through water management. However, in recent years water volume that is needed for proper water management has been limited, for a number of reasons to include drought and funding shortages for pumping of wells. This has resulted in poor recycling of nutrients (i.e. breaking down of decedent vegetation), and encroachment of invasive plants species such as Tall White-top (Lepidium latifolium) and Canadian Thistle (Cirsium arvense).  Proposed management action called for a prescribed burn in this unit in attempts to: 1) remove decadent residual vegetation that is restricting new current year growth plants; 2) attempt to set back encroachment of invasive plant species that is occurring; 3) to allow for maintenance of irrigation infrastructure throughout the unit. The primary question that was raised was if the unit was burned, what would be the effects (if any) on nesting birds, and how long would the effect last? Other questions that were raised were, what \u201cother\u201d bird species are using this habitat, other than waterfowl, and what are their habitat requirements, and are they similar to waterfowl? A proposed 3 year survey project, (pre-burn year survey, burn year survey, and post-burn year survey), was developed to look at these questions."

The ECO3ETALEXIU data product is derived using a physics-based surface energy balance (SEB) algorithm, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (disALEXI). Described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/332/ECO3ETALEXIU_ATBD_V1.pdf), disALEXI is based on spatial disaggregation of regional-scale fluxes from the ALEXI SEB model. Many approaches exist for mapping ET spatially; however, SEB methods are favored for remote sensing retrievals based on land-surface temperature. ALEXI was initially developed for managed landscapes. Applications include crop water use, crop phenology monitoring, and drought early warning or water stress detection. The output ET is generated on a UTM grid at a spatial resolution of 30 meters.

                "text": "Inventory of online public databases and repositories holding agricultural data in 2017 United States agricultural researchers have many options for making their data available online. This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.    Purpose    As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.    An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the Ag Data Commons, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to  establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals    compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms    determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data    ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data  Approach    The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.    Search methods    We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of \u201cagricultural data\u201d /\u201cag data\u201d / \u201cscientific data\u201d + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.    We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of \u201cagriculture\u201d, \u201cag data\u201d and \u201cuniversity\u201d to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University \u2013 International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis \u2013 Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.    Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.    Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.    Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.    Evaluation    We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.    We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.    Results    A summary of the major findings from our data review:  Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.    There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.    Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation."

These five phases differ slightly from the six main steps identified in the IGP grant manual; however, all of the activities reflected in the grant cycle implementation figure (p. 19 of the grants manual) are included in the five phases below. We chose to establish slightly different grant cycle implementation phases so the performance evaluation can address a critical element not reflected in the IGP manual's phases: \u201crevising the process.\u201d This phase is a critical component of the performance evaluation of the IGP facility.    AIR's performance evaluation of the IGP is structured around the five phases of IGP implementation mentioned above. AIR will use the following overarching questions as a framework to the evaluation question design:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   Did the IGP adhere to its objectives:    1.  To increase and sustain the access of the poor to quality water and sanitation and improved drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    2.  To enhance the functioning of the water supply, sewerage, and drainage systems?    3.  To demonstrate an innovative approach or technology to improve water use, sanitation, and hygiene practices among the poor?    4.  To identify and provide assistance to innovative partnership arrangements, particularly through private sector engagement?    5.  To provide significant access by women and vulnerable groups to the IGP and its benefits?    6.  To expand opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generating activities related to water supply, sanitation, and drainage maintenance through solid waste management?    \u00b7   Did the grant selection process prioritize interventions based on its key objectives, and was process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects?    \u00b7   Is grant oversight sufficient?  Is it cost-effective?    \u00b7   How can the Innovation Grant Program better mobilize private-sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCC specifically or another organization best replicate this program?    Start-up: During start- up, we will investigate the effectiveness of the IGP solicitation process to potential grantees. Another key area of interest will be gathering the demographic information of the grantees. The evaluation of the IGP's start-up phase will be based on the questions below:    \u00b7   What is the implementation plan for the grants?    \u00b7   How is information about the program disseminated?     \u00b7   Have there been specific outreach and dissemination activities targeting potential grantees that are best qualified to provide high quality services to women's groups, poor communities, and new entrepreneurs?    \u00b7   Does the MCA provide assistance with grant development, funding guidelines, and budgeting?     \u00b7   Does MCA facilitate connections between (potential) applicants or between applicants and government agencies?    \u00b7   Do targeted communities and stakeholders understand the intention and structure of the grant program?     \u00b7   What is the proportion of grantees from each technical intervention area (i.e. solid waste removal)?     \u00b7   What are potential grantees' and their communities' expectations of the program?     \u00b7   How well informed are potential grantees of the application and selection process, and of the available resources and support to help them participate?    \u00b7   How many grantees apply and how many applications do grantees submit?    \u00b7   How many applications meet the basic qualifications for participation in the program?     \u00b7   Do the interventions supported by the IGP clearly benefit poor communities, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs?     \u00b7   To what extent do the number and nature of applications meet MCA expectations?     \u00b7   To what extent do the applications cover a broad range of services and service areas?    \u00b7   Are proposals received highly relevant to the proposal call area and well distributed across the different calls areas?     \u00b7   Do the problem statements and proposal calls address areas that key IGP stakeholders perceive to be high impact?    Selection: During selection, we will investigate the selection process of the IGP with particular focus on the scoring procedures of the grants. Additionally, AIR will also examine the ways in which selection decisions are communicated to the grantees. Selection questions include:    \u00b7   Does IGPM follow its rules for reviewing, rating, and ranking grant applications?     \u00b7   Are the reviewers adequately trained and supported?     \u00b7   Is the review process fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of potential grantees?    \u00b7   Are grantees notified of the grant decision in a timely and effective way?    \u00b7   Are grantees provided with feedback that enables them to improve their grant application and resubmit?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants understand and accept the outcome of the selection process?     \u00b7   Do rejected applicants plan to resubmit revised applications?     \u00b7   Are rejected applicants requesting assistance with resubmission?     \u00b7   How many grants are awarded?     \u00b7   What is the average grant size?     \u00b7   What proportion of available funds is committed to accepted grants?     \u00b7   Is the grant selection process an efficient and effective way to identify the \u201cbest\u201d projects based on how the projects align with IGP investment criteria?     Implementing the award: During the implementation phase, we will investigate the process of implementing the award. AIR will closely examine the negotiations of grantees' contracts, the process in which funds are disbursed, and the ability of grantees to successfully meet their quarterly goals. Illustrative research questions include:    \u00b7   How did the negotiations of the contract impact the implementation of the award?     \u00b7   Are grantees adequately supported with necessary technical and managerial assistance?    \u00b7   Are funds transmitted to grantees in a timely and efficient way?     \u00b7   Are grantee spending and performance adequately and efficiently monitored?    \u00b7   Do grantees receive timely feedback on their performance?     \u00b7   How does MCA monitor its own performance in the operation of the grant program?    \u00b7   Is MCA meeting its own expectations for successful implementation of the grant program?     \u00b7   How well is the grant program integrated into other compact activities?    \u00b7   What proportion of awarded grant funds is spent on time and on target?     \u00b7   What proportion of grantees achieves their performance objectives at various points throughout the grant period?    \u00b7   Is MCA's oversight of the grants sufficient and cost effective in terms of spending and M&E targets? \u00b7   Does MCA-Zambia/IGPM verify that applicants have met quarterly milestones before awarding the conditional grant disbursements?     \u00b7   What percentages of applicants fail to receive disbursements on time due to failure to meet quarterly milestones?    Completing the award: During the completion phase of the award, we will investigate the sustainability and impact of the grantees' programs. In particular, how effective IGP efforts were in increasing access to clean water and sanitation to vulnerable communities. AIR will pay particular attention to grantees' ability to successfully sustain its programs efforts and the impacts of these programs on their catchment communities. As part of these efforts, AIR will examine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders regarding grantees' programs. However, it is important to note that a full assessment of IGP may not be possible due to the short timeframe.  Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   What proportion of grantees is still active in business at the end of the grant period?    \u00b7   What proportions of the grants demonstrate potentially viable, long-term, profit-generating business opportunities?     \u00b7   How do civil society organizations and policy makers perceive the changes the program has made to the overall infrastructure for water, sanitation, and drainage services in Lusaka?    \u00b7   How aware of the program are households, civil society organizations, policy makers, and other water and sanitation focused stakeholders?     \u00b7   Has the grantee spurred \u201ccopycat\u201d organizations?    \u00b7   Did the grantees feel that they received adequate time to thoroughly complete all of the interventions?    \u00b7    To what extent are the benefits of the program cited as reasons for larger systemic changes by policy makers and compact implementing entities?     \u00b7   What is policy makers and compact implementing entities' perception of the extent to which the program has created individual interventions and structures that are sustainable even after program funding ends?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new partnerships between organizations in water, sanitation, or solid waste value chain?     \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new private sector investment in the sector?    \u00b7   Has the grant program led to new/ refined models of pro-poor service delivery?     \u00b7   What is the perception of benefits to the poor and vulnerable populations?     Revising the process: During this phase, AIR will investigate IGP's ability to successfully meet its objectives. As part of this process, AIR will examine the ways in that the IGP process could be further improved. Illustrative questions include:    \u00b7   Did the program achieve its objectives using the implementation model envisioned?     \u00b7   How can the IGP better mobilize private sector resources?    \u00b7   How can MCA specifically or another organization best replicate this program?"

Invasive species can    alter ecosystem function and structure (e.g., shift fire regimes or nutrient cycling) and change the    distribution, abundance and diversity of native species and communities. The high cost of managing    invasive species combined with decreasing budgets requires that we prioritize which invasive threats to    manage and we use scientifically credible data to inform optimal management decisions and evaluate    progress. A key first step in invasive management is identifying the species of greatest management    concern and conducting an inventory of those species to determine their distribution and abundance.    Inventory data inform management decisions and provide a baseline for evaluating progress. Although    the value of inventory data is well known, inventories are considered a daunting task for many resource    managers because of limited resources or lack of expertise on how to conduct invasive inventories. To    begin addressing these challenges, the NWRS Inventory and Monitoring Initiative and the NWRS    Invasive Species Program initiated the NWRS Invasive Plant Pilot Project (Invasive Pilot) to examine    the diversity of factors influencing how refuges plan and conduct invasive plant inventories. The goals    of the Project are to: (1) evaluate how variation in refuge size, environment, resource availability and    other factors influence planning and implementation of invasive plant inventories and (2) use this    information to inform a NWRS framework or guide for conducting invasive plant inventories. Although    the focus of this effort is on invasive plants, many of the concepts can be applied to other invasive taxa.    This project was administered by invasive plant subject matter experts employed by the U. S. Fish and    Wildlife Service, Utah State University, and Colorado State University."

                "text": "Commercial Net Fishing Estimated Average Annual Catch of Reef Fish, 2003-2013 - Hawaii Nearshore fisheries in the Main Hawaiian Islands encompass a diverse group of fishers using a wide array of gears and targeting many different species. Communities in Hawaii often rely on these fisheries for economic, social, and cultural services. However, the stress from overfishing can cause ecosystem degradation and long-term economic loss. This layer represents the average annual commercial catch of reef fish by net fishing over the years 2003-2013 as reported in commercial catch data collected by the State of Hawaii Department of Aquatic Resources (DAR) Commercial Marine Landings Database (CML). \"Net fishing\" is a fairly broad category that can include everything from hand nets and throw nets to gill nets and seine nets; however, it was not possible to parse out more specific gears due to how DAR reports gear type. Commercial catch is reported to DAR in large irregular reporting blocks by gear and by species.  This layer's spatial footprint aligns with the inshore commercial reporting blocks from the shapefile served on the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program website (Fishchart2008.shp) (http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/). Data are filtered by DAR before release such that reporting blocks with less than three fishers reporting are excluded in order to protect fisher identities. It is not possible to explicitly distinguish between boat-based and shore-based fishing based on the gear types reported in CML data. The Ocean Tipping Points (OTP) project filtered the data for net fishing and reef fish species only and calculated average annual catch in kilograms by reporting block to match with data from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP). In marine protected areas (MPAs) where boat-based fishing is not allowed, catch was set to zero; and inside de facto MPAs with restricted access, catch was reduced according to expert input and local knowledge. Average annual commercial catch data were converted from polygon to raster and then divided by the number of 100-m raster cells within each reporting block so that units are comparable to non-commercial fishing layers (kg/ha). The result assumes commercial catch is evenly distributed spatially across each reporting block."

                "text": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.    The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.    Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.    Technical notes    Nature and sources of data    Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).    The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.    Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).    Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.    Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths    Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).    Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.    Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.    Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report    Provisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.    Percentage of records pending investigation    Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Percent completeness    NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.    Drug specificity    The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.    As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.    Adjustments for delayed reporting    Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.    Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.    The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.    Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

                "text": "Final Topeka shiner Species Status Assessment The Topeka shiner is a small minnow that lives and breeds in graveled pools of low-order prairie streams in the Great Plains states of South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri. It was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1999 as a result of significant population declines due primarily to alteration of prairie stream hydrology and habitat degradation. Post-listing, increased survey efforts revealed additional extant populations, particularly in South Dakota and Minnesota, while population losses and/or reductions appear to continue in other states despite listing protections afforded by the ESA. Since 1999, the Topeka shiner has been documented as occupying 223 small to mid-size streams, composing 87 populations (HUC10 watersheds), and 13 population complexes (groups of hydrologically connected HUC10 watersheds) distributed among the six states known to harbor the species. The majority of Topeka shiners are within northern populations where the species has persisted despite threats occurring on the landscape. Northern populations herein are identified as those occurring in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa, which have in common a relatively recent glacial history resulting in a hydrological regime that may be a key to the persistence of Topeka shiners in these areas despite threats occurring on the landscape. Southern states within the species\u2019 range (defined herein as those in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri) with older glacial records and relatively well drained hydrologic systems have experienced greater Topeka shiner population losses. Exceptions, such as the Flint Hills area of Kansas, have fared better than other areas, likely due likely to the relative lack of habitat impacts that have occurred since European settlement of the Great Plains. The Topeka shiner\u2019s current (defined herein as 1999 and later, based on the species\u2019 listing date and subsequent uptick in survey efforts since that time) six-state distribution, is generally patchy and isolated particularly in the southern parts of the range. Many populations and population complexes are separated by insurmountable distances, impassible structures, and/or unsuitable habitats. Genetic variability in the species exists at a fine scale; adjacent populations existing seemingly without barriers between them can exhibit differences indicative of long-term isolation, perhaps partly due to the species\u2019 typical association with relatively small streams While the Topeka shiner occupies a similar type of habitat across its range (small, low-flowing prairie streams, with sand/gravel/cobble pools), the six-state area composing its range affords some local variation of geophysical conditions. More Topeka shiner population complexes occur in southern states (n=7) than in northern states (n=6) while more populations exist in the north (n=57) than in the south (n=20). Overall resiliency of both populations and population complexes as determined via resiliency modeling is greater in northern states compared to southern. Future scenarios developed for the species herein are based on implementation of comprehensive, effective conservation measures to be applied by states, with progressive improvements in viability realized when the majority of southern states apply such measures.  The ecological requirements of the species, its current condition (based on stream collection records beginning in 1999, when the species was listed and survey efforts increased, through 2017), and projected future conditions based on conservation scenarios are summarized in Table 1 in terms of the \u201c3Rs\u201d (resiliency, redundancy, and representation) that are the cornerstones of species viability. This Species Status Assessment will serve as a basis for consultations under the ESA, and to inform Topeka shiner recovery planning."

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area."

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.    Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).    REFERENCES    1.

General water quality characteristics for surface recharge streams as well as Logan Cave were monitored from Aug 1992 to Dec 1992 to determine the significance of recharge streams to the Logan Cave stream system. A DataSonde 3 Hydrolab Unit recorded water quality for Logan Cave from Aug 1991 to Jan 1993. Rainfall for the recharge area of Logan Cave was also recorded and plotted against Logan Cave water quality parameters. Logan Cave was mapped and classified into regions to monitor cavefish movements. Cavefish were tagged using visual implant tags developed by Northwest Marine Technological Institute. A mark/recapture sampling effort marked a total of 80 cavefish over a six month period, ranging in size from 8 to 65 mm total length. Schnabel and Peterson population estimates yielded 92 and 72 fish, respectively. Cavefish were captured throughout the entire cave system, and moved throughout the entire system as well. Gross movements of the cavefish ranged from 1 m to 985 m. Net/gross movement ratio was higher in the upper region than the lower regions. Movement was positively correlated with size of the fish, with larger fish moving greater distances. Growth was calculated at a rate of .7 mm/month for nine fish. Two hundred and eighty-nine mean daily readings were recorded for conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature from Logan Cave stream, with means of 245.6 uS/cm, 6.95 mg/1, and 14.48\u00b0C, respectively. Rainfall events were closely correlated with fluctuations in the Logan Cave water quality parameters. There was no significant difference (P > .05) between the water quality of Logan Cave stream and its surrounding recharge streams. All heavy metal and pesticide analysis were well below the EPA lower limits."

The salinity of Back Bay has fluctuated up and down between saline, slightly brackish, and a nearly freshwater environment. Anecdotally, Weiland (1897) noted productive oyster beds being replaced by submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), freshwater fisheries and waterfowl use with the closing of Currituck inlet. There has been a general decline in SAV populations, although Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) notes that in 1993 SAV appears to be making a slow come back in some areas. The Refuge also notes that winter waterfowl counts are currently a mere fraction of the observed numbers reported for the early part of this century. Historic waterfowl use observations correspond with a general decline in SAV populations since the early part of this century. Anecdotal observations indicate that the fish population may have been more marine in the early part of the century. Over the last four decades, which have been well documented, the fish species diversity, though nearly 50% freshwater, shows brackish water species accounting for 60% of the standing crop. The formerly renowned citation size largemouth bass fishery has been reduced from 17% of the biomass in 1980 to 2% of the biomass in 1986. Change in salinity (increased salinity proving toxic to young bass) and a lack of submerged aquatic vegetation (food source) have been suggested as possible causes of the declining fishery. In the less saline environment, recruitment of young bass may be more successful than in the past."

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).    Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population.

DEFINITIONS    Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.    Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.    Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.    NOTES    Data on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).    Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.    Hierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).    The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that    1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,    where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).    County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).    SOURCES    National Center for Health Statistics.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

It is located entirely within the city limits of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Historically, Back Bay supported abundant waterfowl and freshwater fisheries. In recent years, however, dramatic declines have occurred in the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) populations within the bay, and concomitantly, populations of fish and birds have declined as well. Although declines in the fauna of Back Bay have generally been attributed to the loss of SAV, determining the cause of SAV decline itself has been difficult. Theories range from increased turbidity in the bay, caused by urban development in the northern portion of the bay's watershed and intensive agricultural activity in the southern portion, to inputs of phytotoxic compounds from a variety of sources, and a naturally occurring pattern of growth and decline in SAV populations. This report describes a contaminant study conducted in Back Bay in the Spring of 1991. The purpose of this study was to perform a preliminary assessment of the impacts of commonly used agricultural chemicals on aquatic organisms in Back Bay. Sediment samples were taken from the major tributaries leading into Back Bay, chemically analyzed, and used in bioassays with a submerged macrophyte species, an amphipod species, and a photoluminescent bacteria. These studies revealed that although some contaminants in the Back Bay sediment were elevated (mainly metals), the bioassay test used indicated the toxicity associated with the sediments is minimal, and generally cannot be correlated with contaminant levels in the sediments."

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to                                     stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.                               Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local                              participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in                              situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of                              census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous                              decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000                              people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic                              status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical                              changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition,                              census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract                              boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or                              incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the                              governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in                              the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These                              noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves                              noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a                              majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized                               American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts                              that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military                              installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained                              only water area, no land area."

                "text": "Data from: Defensive aphid symbiont Hamiltonella defensa effects on Aphelinus glycinis and Aphelinus atriplicis Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa /APSE by two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.    Insect sources and rearing conditions    Aphelinus glycinis was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect Aphis craccivora or Acyrthosiphon pisum because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.    Aphis craccivora is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Acyrthosiphon pisum is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Aphis craccivora in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and Ac. pisum were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, Vicia faba L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in H. defensa in Ac. pisum and APSE type 4 was found in H. defensa in Ap. craccivora. Aphid lines without H. defensa were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on V. fava plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of H. defensa from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from Ap. craccivora and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from Ac. craccivora were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of H. defensa and APSE prior to assays.    Aphelinus atriplicis was collected as mummified Diuraphis noxia on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; A. glycinis was collected as mummified Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. Aphelinus glycinis was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); A. atriplicis was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the Aphelinus varipes complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. Aphelinus atriplicis was reared on D. noxia on barley, Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae); Aphelinus glycinis was reared on Aphis glycines on soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of A. glycines was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither D. noxia nor A. glycines are known to harbor H. defensa, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of H. defensa in our colonies of these species. Although A. glycines harbors another bacterium, Arsenophonus, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.    Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with Hamiltonella defensa versus uninfected aphids    To measure the effect of infection with H. defensa harboring APSE on parasitism of Ap. craccivora and Ac. craccivora, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of Aphelinus atriplicis or Aphelinus glycinis that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with H. defensa or uninfected aphids on V. faba variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. Aphelinus females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.    The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.    Aphids parasitized by these Aphelinus species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.    Design structure    The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for Aphelinus glycinis on Ap. craccivora and Aphelinus atriplicis on Ap. craccivora and on Ac. pisum (24 each for Hamiltonella-infected versus uninfected aphids)."

The goal is to establish a baseline for future studies and to assist the managers in identifying potential impacts to fish and wildlife resources from environmental contaminants. Sediment and soil were sampled at three refuges of the Complex, Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Amagansett NWR, and Oyster Bay NWR, in 1991 and analyzed for inorganic and organic chemical residues. In addition, Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) eggs were collected from Wertheim NWR and field mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. Ieucopus) were collected from Amagansett NWR to assess inorganic and organic chemical burdens in wildlife. Sediment collected from Wertheim NWR in 1 991 had levels of lead, mercury, zinc, copper, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and manganese exceeding at least one of the concern levels reviewed. No polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concern levels were exceeded in any of the sediment samples from Wertheim NWR in 1991. A review of the analysis of the sediment samples collected from Wertheim in 1990 determined that the same inorganic residues were found to exceed the concern levels (Mann and Karwowski 1991). Sediment collected from Oyster Bay NWR in 1991 had levels of lead, copper, mercury, and zinc exceeding at least one of the concern levels reviewed. No PAH concern levels were exceeded in any of the sediment samples collected from Oyster Bay NWR in 1991. A review of the analysis of the sediment samples collected from Oyster Bay in 1990 determined that the same inorganic residues were found to exceed the concern levels as well as nickel, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, and silver (Mann and Karwowski 1991). The sediment samples collected in 1990 had contaminant burdens significantly higher than the 199 1 samples. These samples were collected closer to potential contaminant sources than the 1991 samples. Both of the Mute Swan eggs collected at Wertheim NWR exceeded the predator protection levels for chromium, 0.2,ug/g (Eisler 1986) and selenium, 0.5,ug/g (Walsh et al. 1977). The mice collected at Amagansett NWR exceeded the predator protection levels suggested for arsenic, 0.5,ug/g and selenium (Walsh et al. 1 977). The 1991 sediment sampling results at Wertheim NWR and Oyster Bay NWR confirmed the 1990 findings. There is a transport of contaminants onto these refuges. On Wertheim NWR, three areas can be considered depositional areas which indicate the maximum contamination on the refuge. The biological uptake of the contaminants discovered in the sediment at both refuges needs to be determined. Biological samples were collected at both refuges during the 1992 sampling seasons. The results of these samples will be reported on in a future report."

                "text": "Mozambique - Farmer Income Support Trees  For the epidemic zone, the evaluation estimated the impact of FISP on disease prevalence and estimated the consequent impact on coconut production and farmer incomes. In addition, the evaluation also assessed the pre-conditions for future increase in income by examining whether the seedlings planted through FISP survived.     To assess these impacts, because the ideal approach of randomly assigning treatment to farmers was not feasible, the evaluation employed the next best approach. It identified geographic areas that were very similar at baseline and were otherwise split into treatment and comparison areas by some external \u201cquasi-random\u201d factor (the phytosanitary barrier), and matched a subset of these areas on disease prevalence and distance to coast. This approach is sometimes called a \u201cborder discontinuity\u201d design in the applied microeconomics literature. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the phytosanitary barrier was a north-to-south imaginary line that FISP delineated, separating the areas with less than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the west side of the barrier) from the areas with more than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the east side). FISP worked on the west side of the barrier. Defined this way, the project worked in the entire epidemic zone.     However, in effect this barrier was imperfect because while it is true that generally (or on average) the disease prevalence is greater near the coast, the disease prevalence has a mosaic pattern. This means that even on the east side of the barrier, there can be areas with disease prevalence lower than 10 percent. Furthermore, the barrier was imperfectly drawn even along the perceived divide of 10 percent prevalence, as it was drawn along natural barriers such as water bodies and roads. These characteristics of the barrier and how the FISP treatment areas were defined give a unique opportunity to identify the counterfactual areas in the areas just east of the barrier. Accordingly, we used the 2008 TTI aerial photography data (TTI Production, 2009) to identify areas with similar disease prevalence as proximate as possible to either side of the barrier, with the areas on the west side serving as treatment areas, and areas on the east side serving as the comparison areas .     From among all FISP project areas on the east side of the barrier, and the non-project areas on the west side of the barrier, we identified areas where the disease prevalence was between 0 and 15 percent. These treatment and comparison areas amounted to 93 project and 65 non-project census enumeration areas (EAs) very close (within 73 kilometers) to the phytosanitary barrier that shared similar disease prevalence. Within these areas, we further refined the sample and identified approximately 24 nearest neighbor pairs of EAs matched on baseline disease prevalence and distance to coast. Our sample selection procedure, which resulted in 48 EAs, limits analysis and direct applicability to areas close to the phytosanitary barrier. The pairs were matched on:     Same district    Average baseline CLYD prevalence in 2008, in the 5-kilometer radius    Distance to coast.    No counterfactual EA was \u201cmatched\u201d with more than one treatment EA.  A small wrinkle in this identification strategy was that the FISP phytosanitary barrier was reevaluated a total of five times throughout the project, causing the barrier to shift during the course of the implementation (see Figure 2-1). To ensure that all comparison areas did not receive treatment, we have chosen comparison located east of the 2012 barrier, which is the furthest east the barrier was shifted over the course of the project.     It is important to note that in three out of the eight FISP districts there was no barrier drawn: in Pebane, Moma, and Angoche, the barrier was the coast, and FISP worked in these districts in a way that made it difficult to identify non-project areas. There was no barrier drawn in the district of Chinde, but epidemic and endemic zones (as well as project and non-project areas) were geographically separated in a way that allowed us to include the district in our sampling frame. As a result, our quantitative evaluation is focused on five out of the eight FISP districts (Nicoadala, Namacurra, Maganja da Costa, Chinde, and Inhassunge). In the remaining three districts in the Nampula district, we relied on a qualitative survey to draw lessons about the project's efficacy.    In sum, the phytosanitary barrier distinguished between epidemic FISP areas and epidemic non-FISP areas. We identified 93 FISP census EAs on the west side of the barrier and 65 non-project EAs on the east side of the phytosanitary barrier but very close (within 73 kilometers) with similar baseline disease prevalence (using the 2008 aerial photography data from TTI Production, 2009). From these, 24 pair-wised matched project and non-project areas serve as our treatment and comparison groups. Their baseline similarity, geographical similarity, and haphazard separation by the phytosanitary barrier create the ideal conditions for a quasi-experimental evaluation. This quasi-random approach identifies the impact because difference in outcomes can be attributed only to the intervention; other potentially confounding factors are similar across the phytosanitary barrier, due to geographic proximity and because of matching (Section 5.3 provides more details on the results of the matching).   Households  We designed two separate quantitative evaluations to assess the activities in the epidemic zones and the endemic zones.     Evaluation of Epidemic Zone Program: In the epidemic zones, the evaluation used a border discontinuity design. Specifically, it identified geographic areas that were very similar at baseline, except that they were split into treatment and comparison areas by an external \u201cquasi-random\u201d factor-the phytosanitary barrier. The phytosanitary barrier was a north-to-south imaginary line that FISP delineated, separating the areas with less than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the west side of the barrier) from the areas with more than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the east side). FISP did not conduct any epidemic zone activities east of this barrier. Despite the clear distinction of the barrier for implementation activities, the disease had a mosaic pattern, implying that the barrier was imperfect at delineating CLYD prevalence levels. This feature aided our evaluation, because we were able to select comparison areas to the east of the barrier that had roughly the same qualifications for selection (baseline disease prevalence) as the treatment areas. Among a subset of the census enumeration areas (EAs) on both sides of the barrier that had less than 15 percent disease prevalence, we matched EAs based on distance from coast (which also proxies for distance to barrier) and baseline disease prevalence. This strategy was feasible in five out of the eight FISP districts. In the remaining three districts in the Nampula province, where the epidemic and endemic zone programs were combined and there was no barrier separating project areas, we relied on qualitative data to assess the project.     To assess impact on outcomes related to household income coconut production and seedling survival, the unit of analysis was households. We sampled 800 households across 24 treatment and 24 comparison EAs. After accounting for nonresponse, missing observations, and outliers, we obtained a study sample of 666 usable observations. For each household we gathered information on their pre-intervention demographic characteristics and information to measure the key outcomes: seedling survival, coconut production, and income.     To assess the impact of FISP on disease prevalence, we surveyed 16,000 trees that were sampled from the same enumeration areas as the household survey in the epidemic zones. We first identified the land area within the matched EAs that had tree cover, based on the 2008 aerial photography data. Within these areas, we randomly sampled 400 grids, each 100 by 100 meters, and within each grid we drew a sample of 40 trees in four clusters. For each tree in the grid, the tree enumerators visually inspected whether the tree was healthy; had only CLYD (and not beetle infestation); had beetle infestation only; or had CLYD and beetle infestation.  The enumerators assessed beetle infestation also because CLYD is closely associated with increase in beetle infestation since dead trees - dead because of CLYD - can become a breeding ground for beetles.     To answer the question on FISP's impact on disease spread, however, we could not apply this method because that requires time series information on disease spread before, during, and after FISP. We conducted the analysis on two pairs of treatment and comparison areas for which we could find satellite data to estimate the prevalence of healthy trees between 2008 and 2014.     Evaluation of the Endemic Zone Program: In the endemic zones, which were entirely east of the phytosanitary barrier, the evaluation used a non-experimental method for selecting untreated geographic areas that, at baseline, were very similar to the treated areas. We matched pairs of treatment and comparison enumeration areas on baseline disease prevalence and distance from coast. The results of our matching and comparison of their self-reported pre-intervention characteristics suggest that the two groups are comparable and did not require any re-weighting to \u201clook similar.\u201d    In the endemic zone, we surveyed 720 households in 80 EAs across all districts. Of the 720 households surveyed, 561 observations were usable. In addition to information gathered for the epidemic zone farmers, for endemic zone farmers we also gathered information on their adoption, production, and sale of crops promoted by FISP.    Other Questions: To answer other questions, including the assessment of the BDF activity, the R&D activity, and the adaptation and adherence of FISP implementation to project goals, we conducted a desktop review of the literature. In addition, for the BDF activities and assessment of FISP's adaptation and adherence to project goals, we conducted interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions and interviews with farmers and grant recipients."

The future management goal is to use the wetlands on the Area to treat water from these sources and provide discharge to the Walker River to benefit water levels in Walker Lake without impacting agricultural uses. This investigation was conducted to assess the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality for discharge and to assess the effects of alternative water sources to fish, wildlife, and their habitats on the wetlands. The objectives of this study were to: assess environmental contaminant concerns in relation to water sources and identify those with adverse effects on fish, wildlife, and their habitats; identify risks to humans using the area; document water quality for potential release; and determine if contaminants have the potential to accumulate in the wetlands and associated biota. Data collection in 1998-2000 included: field measurements of water quality in wetlands; chemical analysis of water quality in selected wetlands having different sources of water; chemical analysis of sediment, vegetation, aquatic invertebrates, and fish from selected wetlands; the assessment of plant and aquatic invertebrate community characteristics; and the assessment of fish condition and health. In general, water quality was related to water sources and the position of wetlands in the system. The highest quality waters were in water delivery systems from the fish hatchery, Walker River, and in primary wetlands. Continued monitoring of water quality and contaminants in sediments and biota is needed to properly assess future risks."

The land transaction (purchase, rentals, and mortgage) is an indicator of land market growth and will be measured using the administrative records at Land Administration Units (LAUs). The \u201cDUAT transaction\u201d time is defined as the time period between DUAT application and issuance by municipality offices and indicator of efficiency in providing land administration services. To achieve this objective, data from two different sources was obtained, including district and municipalities. In the municipalities, data was retrieved from the land administrative offices records in 16 municipalities (9 treatment and 7 control sites). Essentially, records on land registration was retrieved, copied to PDFs and entered into digital form. The second data source is the administrative data obtained from the provincial land administrative offices (SPGCs) in the four provinces in North-Central Mozambique where the Millennium Challenge Account implemented its land tenure project. Note that, data obtained in the districts was in digital form (Access) converted to Stata for analysis.  A total of 11,311 land titles were compiled from the existing records from the two data sources."

The site model files provided include both calibrated and uncalibrated simulations of various steady-state and transient hydrologic conditions. Simulations were accomplished with equivalent porous media models that allow laminar flow only (MODFLOW) or laminar and non-laminar flow in a model layer (MODFLOW-CFP mode 2) and hybrid model simulations (MODFLOW-CFP mode 1 one-dimensional pipe network linked to equivalent porous media model). The test examples of the application of equivalent porous media model (the sponge) with and without turbulence and a hybrid model (sponge with pipes) to the Woodville Karst Plain near Tallahassee, Florida, indicated that for annual, monthly, or seasonal average hydrologic conditions, all methods met calibration criteria (matched observed water levels and average flow). Thus, the increased effort, such as the collection of data on conduit location and the computational time of a hybrid model, is not necessary for simulation of average hydrologic conditions (simulation of non-laminar flow was not critical). However, simulation of a large storm event in the Woodville Karst Plain with daily stress periods (52-day period beginning August 13, 2008) indicated that turbulence is important for matching daily springflow hydrographs and models calibrated to average conditions did not match daily storm spring hydrographs. All models were developed from an equivalent porous media model for the area calibrated by J.

The black tern nesting population showed a drop from the high of 100 pairs in 1999 to only 53 pairs found in 2001. All black tern nesting in Vermont in 2001 was found at Mud Creek Wildlife Management Area in Alburg and Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton.   This is cause for concern because it means that all nesting is in one confined area, with no nesting at the south end of Lake Champlain or on Lake Memphremagog as in past. A minimum estimate of at least 29 young black terns fledged from the area around Missisquoi National Wildlife  Refuge, approximately 0.5 fledglings per pair. This is not thought to be adequate to maintain the population, but the nature of the estimate makes it an absolute minimum. In addition, the survey of selected marshes in Vermont for other marsh birds (pied-billed grebe, least bittern, American bittern, Virginia rail, sora, common moorhen, and American coot) was continued. Fifteen marsh bird routes situated in emergent marshes within state Wildlife Management Areas, Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge, or in marshes designated as \"Important Bird Areas\" were surveyed. Virginia rail is still the most common and abundant marsh bird surveyed, followed by the common moorhen, with least bittern, sora, American bittern, pied-billed grebe, and American coot being uncommon and sporadic. These ongoing activities together have two major objectives: to look at marsh bird population trends within the marshes of Vermont and to investigate the effect of water level and marsh vegetation changes on marsh bird numbers."

In the 809 days we were present, we conducted 53 studies or surveys of birds in the region. We gathered information on 185 species, of which 65% (121) nested, 10% (19) probably nested, and 11% (21) were permanent residents in the region. Most breeding or probably breeding forms were of North American (58%; 81) or Beringian (24%; 33) affinity, while the remainder of the species were of Panborcal (17%; 24) and Old World (1%; 2) affinity. Similarly, most of the 44 migrants and visitants were of North American (41%; 18) affinity, while the remainder were of Beringian (32%; 14) and Panboreal (27%; 12) afilnity. Of the 140 species that nested or probably nested, 53% (73) were abundant to fairly common, 29% (40) were uncommon to very rare, and 20% (27) were localized. Shrub thicket, dwarf shrub mat, coniferous forest, deciduous forest, mixed deciduous-coniferous forest, and fluviatile water and shoreline habitats supported the greatest diversity of species breeding and suspected of breeding. The highest concentrations of birds occurred in the estuaries of Nanvak, Chagvan, and Goodnews bays during spring and fall migrations and on the coastal and island cliffs during the breeding season. The information presented here provides the basis for range extensions of several species. Our records further clarify the known or probable Alaska breeding ranges of 11 species (fork-tailed storm-petrel, Oceanodroma furcata; double-crested cormorant, Phalacrocorax aurltus; red-faced cormorant, Phalacrocorax urile; brant, Branta bernicla; king eider, Somateria spectabilis; white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus; black-bellied plover, Pluvlalis squatarola; Pacific golden-plover, Pluvlalis fulva; lesser yellowlegs, Tringa jlavtpes; Say's phoebe, Sayornis saya; and Bohemian waxwing, Bombycilla garrulus). We also provide further information on distributions or documentation of unusual occurrences for nine taxa (frigatebird, Fregata spp.; Baikal teal, Anas formosa; American kestrel, Falco sparverius; Terek sandpiper, Xenus cinereus; bristle-thighed curlew, Numenius tahttiensis; slaty-hacked gull, Larus schistisagus; rufous hummingbird, Selasphorus rujus; song sparrow, Melosplza melodla; and red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus). We provide quantitative data on the coastal migration of 11 species along Bristol Bay (red-throated loon, Gavia stellata; Pacific loon, Gavia pacijica; pelagic cormorant, Phalacrocorax pelagicus; emperor goose, Chen canaglca; brant; Steller's eider, Polysticta stelleri; common eider, Somaterla molllssima; king eider; black scoter, Melantua nlgra; white-winged scoter, Melanitta fusca; and swf scoter, Melanltta persptcillata). We document changes in nesting densities, differences in numbers, or habitat variations of 32 species in response to human activities (e.g., semipalrnated plover, Charadrius semipalmatus; arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea; tree swallow, Tachyctneta bicolor. varied thrush, Ixoreus naevius; yellow-rumped warbler, Dendroica coronata; and American tree sparrow, Splzella arborea).

                "text": "1991 Piping Plover and Least Tern Management Plan The piping plover (Charadrius melodus) , a North. American beach nesting bird, has been declining in numbers for decades. Although a number of factors are responsible for decreasing numbers and productivity, increased development of their ephemeral and vulnerable habitat, direct and indirect effects of human  disturbance and activity, and predation are most frequently cited (Burger 1987, Haig and Oring 1987, Dyer et al 1988). Concern for the species led to the listing of the Atlantic Coast population of the piping plover as threatened in 1986. The least tern (Sterna antillarum), another beach nesting bird, is designated as a Species of- Special Concern by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Partly due to intense management and monitoring efforts, least terns are increasing in numbers in Massachusetts, which has one of the largest populations on the Atlantic Coast. With the development and alteration of beaches along the Atlantic Coast, the preservation and management of the undeveloped beach habitat at Parker River for the piping plover and least tern became increasingly important. With habitat available, it became apparent here that the important limiting factors were impacts from  recreational activities (over-sand vehicles, pedestrians and pets) , and predation. Censusing and management efforts including public education, beach  zonation, spot fencing, and predator control have increased at many locations and are frequently coordinated through State authorities. It appears that the combination of management techniques employed at Parker River NWR along with enhanced habitat and benefits from successes here and elsewhere led to a successful 1990 season. This Plan discusses efforts by Parker River NWR for managing piping plovers and least terns for the 1991 season."

During this period observers were present 473 days and obtained    records for all seasons. The avifauna was found to be predominantly a mixture of Panboreal (39%), North American    (34%), and Aleutican (19%) species with the Aleutican group dominant in terms of numbers and biomass. A total of 125 species was recorded: 63% (79 of 125) were water-associated. Forty-two species were confirmed breeding in    the area and another 19 were suspected of breeding. The majority of species occurred as migrants; 11 were considered permanent residents and an additional 23 were winter residents. Our observations extended the known Alaska breeding distribution of American wigeon (Anas americana), black turnstone (Arenaria melanocephala), northern phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), western sandpiper (C. mauri), dunlin (Calidris alpina), horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), tufted puffin (Lunda cirrhata), and orange-crowned warbler (Vermivora celata). Our observations also extended the known postbreeding range or significantly changed the known status of bar-tailed godwit (Limosa 1apponica), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes), long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus), dunlin (C. alpina), marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata), and dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). The area is a principal late summer and fall molting and staging area for several species of arctic and subarctic nesting waders and seaducks and emperor geese (Anser canagica). From late September through mid-October densities of water birds on littoral and nearshore areas approached 1000 birds km\u207b\u00b2. These densities were exceeded many fold for certain species on particular habitat types in the area."

The Lidar Level 2 Aerosol Profile data products contain averaged aerosol profile data and ancillary data. There are no layer descriptors included in the lidar aerosol profile data products. The spatial distribution of the aerosol layers is instead completely characterized by the aerosol layer fraction and atmospheric volume description parameters. The aerosol profile products are generated at a uniform horizontal resolution of 5 km. The aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficients are computed using a lidar ratio selected by the CALIPSO Lidar Ratio selection algorithm. The science algorithms used to produce the V3.30 CALIOP data products are identical to those used to generate the V3.01 and V3.02 products; however, some of the ancillary data used in the v3.30 analyses is different. All CALIOP data products rely on meteorological data provided by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO).

Most data were collected along the same transects where channel topography was measured (see related child item in this data release: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a989288e4b06990606de04b). Measurements of sediment ranging from medium sand to boulders were made using the CobbleCam digital photographic technique (Warrick and others, 2009), which uses a calibrated autocorrelation algorithm (Rubin, 2004) to calculate the mean grain size of sediment from pixels in downward-looking digital photographs. This technique yields grain-size values accurate to within 14 percent of those obtained by pebble counting (Wolman, 1954; Warrick and others, 2009). For samples finer than medium sand, we measured grain size using a Coulter laser particle-size analyzer at the USGS laboratory in Santa Cruz, California. Grain size was measured along subaerial portions of the survey transects within the bankfull channel. We also measured grain size of some sediment deposited after dam removal that did not coincide with survey transects (these sample locations are labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cOffTransect\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the data file).

Critical sediment properties, such as compressibility, can change in response to pore-fluid chemistry changes, particularly if the sediment contains appreciable concentrations of fine-grained materials. Pore-fluid changes act at the micro scale, altering interactions between sediment particles, or between sediment particles and the pore fluid. These micro-scale alterations change how sediment fabrics and void ratios develop, which directly impacts macro-scale properties such as sediment compressibility. The goal of this study is to correlate sediment compressibility, a macro-scale property, to the micro-scale pore-fluid chemistry effects and ultimately to the electrical sensitivity for each sediment. Such a correlation would allow compressibility behavior to be estimated from knowledge of the index properties and mineralogy profile for each sediment. The data in this release support the correlation effort by providing: 1) sedimentation results that provide insight into micro-scale sediment fabric and void ratio dependence on sediment/fluid interactions, and 2) consolidation results that quantify the macro-scale compressibility and recompressibility parameters for a suite of fine-grained sediments and differing pore fluids. The related journal publication (Jang and others, 2018) demonstrates how the macro-scale compressibility and recompressibility results from the consolidation tests are linked back, through the sediment fabric and void ratio data from the sedimentation tests, to the micro-scale impact of pore-fluid chemistry and sediment electrical sensitivity."

The issue is particularly important in Arctic Ocean waters since rapid warming there increases the likelihood that gas hydrate--an ice-like form of methane and water stable at particular pressure and temperature conditions within marine sediments--will break down and release its methane to the overlying ocean. Some researchers have even proposed the possibility of an Arctic methane catastrophe characterized by wholesale breakdown of gas hydrates in marine sediments and release of the methane to the atmosphere as climate warms. This dataset collected on the West Spitsbergen margin during U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program Field Activity 2014-013-FA, which was carried out in conjunction with the University of Tromso and the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel on the R/V Helmer Hanssen, records 30-second-gridded methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in near-surface seawater and the atmospheric marine boundary layer, the carbon-13 isotopic composition of methane and carbon dioxide in the near-surface waters, and also environmental parameters (e.g., seawater salinity, wind speed, water and air temperatures).

The trials provide an evaluation of experimental breeding lines in alternate test sites that are environmentally similar or dissimilar to the program of origin. Data from USDA-ARS Hard Winter Wheat Regional Nurseries grown in 1987 to 2014 were used to identify similarities among Great Plains test sites. Mean correlations of entry grain yields across locations and years were used in principal factor analyses to cluster them into production zones. The procedures used were identical to those of a previously published analysis using test data from 1959 to 1989. Five factors explained 67% of the variance in the correlation matrix among Southern Regional Performance Nursery (SRPN) locations. The analysis divided the SRPN into four major Great Plains production zones, designated Southeast, Northwest, Southwest and Northeast. The remaining minor production zone consisted of only two central South Dakota locations, both outside the typical target area and selection site of SRPN entries. In the Northern Regional Performance Nursery (NRPN), five production zones were established, with location separation predominantly resulting from east\u2013west differences in performance. The SRPN and NRPN wheat production zones closely follow previously described ecological zones of adaptation of native Great Plains plant species. Wheat breeding programs and growers may continue to use the production zones established via the USDA-ARS coordinated winter wheat regional nurseries to target and select germplasm for crossing and for production."

Methane gas hydrate is a naturally occurring crystalline solid that sequesters methane in individual molecular cages in a lattice of water molecules. Methane gas hydrate is a potential energy resource, but whether extracting methane from gas hydrate in the marine subsurface is technically and economically viable remains an open research topic as of 2018. This data release provides insight about a poorly quantified aspect of this process: the reaction of fine-grained sediment particles (fines) to the change in pore water chemistry that occurs when methane is extracted from gas hydrate. Fines are an issue for production because they can get resuspended in the flow of fluid and gas toward the extraction well. As fines move, they can cluster and subsequently clog pore throats in the sediment, reducing permeability (which controls how easily methane can flow toward the extraction well). There are two main factors in determining the cluster structure (the size and fabric of the cluster) and the cluster formation and settling rates: the type of fine-grained particle and the chemistry of the surrounding pore water. Data in this study provide insight into both factors. Fine particles interact with each other primarily in response to electrical forces, and changes in pore water chemistry can significantly alter how those forces are communicated between particles. In marine systems, in situ pore water is an electrically conductive brine. As gas hydrate dissociates, however, fresh water is released along with the methane, making the pore water less conductive. Depending on the type of fine-grained particles involved, the pore water chemistry change enhances or diminishes the clustering and changes the rates at which the clusters form and settle. For this data release, specimens from the NGHP-02 expedition are observed during sedimentation (settling) tests in pore fluids of differing chemistry. The results included in this data release can (1) provide insight into the types of fines present, which can be difficult to quantify if using the more standard x-ray diffraction method for identifying fines and (2) indicate whether the in situ fines are likely to increase or decrease their capacity to clog pore throats as the pore water transitions from higher to lower salinity during gas hydrate dissociation."

The Central Valley encompasses an approximate 50,000 square-kilometer region of California. The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the USGS numerical modeling code MODFLOW-FMP (Schmid 2006b). This simulation is referred to here as the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) (Faunt, 2009). Utilizing MODFLOW-FMP, the CVHM simulates groundwater- and surface-water flow, irrigated agriculture, land subsidence, and other key processes in the Central Valley on a monthly basis from 1961-2003. The total active modeled area is 20,334 square-miles on a finite- difference grid comprising 441 rows and 98 columns. Slightly less than 50 percent of the cells are active. The CVHM model grid has a uniform horizontal discretization of 1x1 square mile and is oriented parallel to the valley axis, 34 degrees west of north (Faunt, 2009). Both the elastic and inelastic components of skeletal specific storage (Ssf) were simulated with the SUB package. The elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients were calculated as the product of the estimated elastic- and inelastic-specific storage values for coarse- and fine-grained materials and the aggregate thicknesses of those materials in each cell. The elastic skeletal storage coefficient of the coarse-grained deposits was estimated from the product of the aggregate thickness of coarse-grained deposits and the difference between estimated elastic-specific storage and the specific storage representing the compressibility of water (Hanson, 1988; Faunt, 2009). Critical head is another parameter used by the SUB package that strongly affects storage changes, particularly the timing of those changes. Critical head is the equivalent head at which effective or intergranular stress is equal to the pre-consolidation stress (Faunt, 2009). The equivalent critical head, or preconsolidation stress, represents the threshold stress that determines whether changes in stress deform the granular skeleton elastically or inelastically. For head changes (whether positive or negative) in the range of heads greater than the critical head, the skeleton deforms elastically. For head changes in the range of heads less than the critical head, the mode of skeletal deformation depends on the sense of the head change--a positive change (head increase) causes elastic deformation, and a negative change (head decrease) causes inelastic deformation and re-establishes a new critical head. In the upper three model layers, specified initial critical- head values were equal to the water levels estimated for the spring of 1961 (starting head values used in CVHM). In the lower seven model layers, the initial critical heads initially were derived from those estimated by Williamson and others (1989). These heads are approximate and were interpolated from the minimum historical head values simulated in the CV-RASA model. In the final calibration, specified initial critical heads were equal to the head simulated in CVHM in September 1961. These values approximate the minimum historical head value in 1961 (Faunt, 2009).The CVHM is the most recent regional-scale model of the Central Valley developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The CVHM was developed as part of the USGS Groundwater Resources Program (see \"Foreword\", Chapter A, page iii, for details)."

This data release provides results for flow-through permeability, consolidation, and direct shear measurements made on fine-grained seal sediment from Site NGHP-02-08 offshore eastern India. The sediment was collected in a pressure core from the Krishna-Godavari Basin during the 2015 Indian National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 2 (NGHP-02). Gas hydrate is a crystalline solid that forms naturally in the sediment of certain marine and permafrost environments where pressure is relatively high (equivalent to the pressure measured at ~300 meters water depth or more) and temperature is relatively low (but generally above freezing). The concentration of methane can be high enough to make certain gas hydrate occurrences potentially relevant as energy resources. To extract methane from gas hydrate, the in situ formation (generally a coarse-grained, gas-hydrate-bearing sediment interval) can be depressurized by drawing pore water out through a production well. As the pore pressure falls below the gas hydrate stability limit, the solid gas hydrate breaks down, releasing gas and water that migrate toward the production well for collection. How effectively the production well can depressurize the gas-hydrate-bearing interval depends on how permeable the overlying seal sediment is. If the seal is permeable, depressurizing the reservoir to extract methane causes water to flow out of the seal and into the reservoir. This can limit the ability of the production well to maintain the low reservoir pressure required to break down gas."

Fines within these sandy sediments can be mobilized and subsequently clog flow pathways while methane is being extracted from gas hydrate as an energy resource. Using two-dimensional (2D) micromodels to test the conditions in which clogging occurs provides insights for choosing production operation parameters that optimize methane recovery in the field. During methane extraction, several processes can alter the mobility and clogging potential of fines: (1) fluid flow as the formation is depressurized to release methane from gas hydrate, (2) shifting pore-fluid chemistry as pore-fluid brine freshens as a result of pure water released from dissociating gas hydrate, and (3) the migration of gas/water interfaces, which are created as gas evolves from dissociating gas hydrate. In this study, 2D micromodel experiments were conducted on a selection of pure fines, natural sediments, pore-fluids, and micromodel pore-throat sizes to evaluate fines migration and changes in clogging behavior resulting from methane gas production and pore-water freshening during hydrate dissociation. Additionally, tests were run with and without an invading gas phase (carbon dioxide) to test the importance of a moving meniscus on fines mobility and clogging. The endmember fine particles chosen for this research included silica silt, mica, calcium carbonate, diatoms, kaolinite, illite, and bentonite (primarily made of montmorillonite). The pore fluids included deionized water, sodium chloride brine (2 molar concentration), and carbon dioxide gas. The microfluidic pore models, used as porous media analogs, were fabricated with pore-throat widths of 20, 40, 60 and 100 micrometers to cover the range of anticipated pore throat sizes sampled during NGHP-02. This dataset provides a clogging diagram showing how grain size, fines concentration, pore fluid chemistry and mobile interfaces define the clogging behavior of the pure fines. This fundamental properties diagram helps interpret the clogging behavior of three natural samples also tested for this dataset. The natural samples were collected during NGHP-02. This research shows that in addition to the expected dependence of clogging on the ratio of particle-to-pore-throat size, pore-fluid chemistry is also an important factor because the interaction between a particular type of fine and pore fluid influences that fine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to cluster, clump together, and thereby increase the effective particle size relative to the pore-throat width. The presence of a moving gas/fluid meniscus increases the clogging potential regardless of fine type because the advancing meniscus tends to gather and concentrate the fines."

The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv)."

                "text": "Evapotranspiration by woody phreatophytes in the Humboldt River Valley near Winnemucca, Nevada This report presents the results of cooperative studies ofevapotranspiration by phreatophytes in the Winnemucca reachof the Humboldt River valley. Water that is wasted by evapotranspirationfrom areas of low beneficial phreatophytes is oneof the largest unknowns in the water budget of the reach.In order to obtain information with which to evaluate theconsumptive waste, studies of the water use of four woodyphreatophytes greasewood, rabbitbrush, willow, and wildrosewere undertaken in evapotranspiration tanks at the Winnemuccatest site.Twelve tanks ranging in size from 30 feet square and 10.5 feetdeep to 10 feet square and 7 feet deep were constructed. Seedlingsof greasewood were planted in 2 tanks and rabbitbrush in3 tanks; cuttings of willow were planted in 3 tanks and wildrosein 3 tanks. The twelfth was left bare. The tanks wereconstructed in place by lining excavated pits with watertightplastic membranes, providing a water-distribution system on thebottom and backfilling with the excavated material. The tankswere operated during the growing season April 1 to October 20from 1961-67, inclusive. Water metered into elevated reservoirswas supplied by gravity to the evapotranspiration tanks.Evapotranspiration by the plants was computed as the sum ofrainfall, soil-moisture depletion and water supplied to the tanksduring the growing season. Plant growth and development wererecorded by photographs and transects. Foliage volumes werecomputed from the transect data as the product of the averageheight, the cover density of the plants, and the area of the tank.Foliage volumes and water use were affected by difference indepths to the water level, damage to the plants by rabbits and byinsects, and, for the greasewood and rabbitbrush, by accumulationof boron in toxic concentrations in the root zone. The damageswere alleviated by removing rabbits from the test site, byspraying the insect-infested plants, and by reducing the boroncontent in the root zone by backwash leaching.Boron content of undisturbed soil, adjacent to the greasewoodtanks, ranged from 13 to 32 milligrams per kilogram in thetop 1.5 feet, and from 5 to 0.9 milligrams per kilogram between5 and 9 feet. Green greasewood leaves had a boron content thatranged from 196 to 233 milligrams per kilogram.Evapotranspiration by a given species of phreatophytes isaffected by climatic conditions, of which temperature is themost important. Water use by greasewood and rabbitbrush inApril was only about 2 percent of the yearly total, whereas duringthe months of peak use it was 28 percent. More than twothirdsof the annual use occurred during June, July, and August.Evapotranspiration, expressed on an areal basis as depth overa unit area, gives no indication of growth conditions for whichthe information was obtained and may result in serious errorwhen transposed to areas of dissimilar growth conditions. Someof the difficulties and uncertainties of the areal method may beavoided by expressing evapotranspiration on a volume-of-foliagebasis, as a quantity of water per unit of foliage volume. Themethod presumes that transpiration by a species is proportionalto the total transpiring leaf area, and so proportional to thefoliage volume. In the results of the studies, evapotranspirationis expressed in both quantities. The annual use of water rangedrather widely over the study period, as the plants responded tothe effect of plant damage, boron toxicity, depth to the waterlevel, and warmth and length of the growing seasons. Draft fromthe water table, equivalent to the water supplied to the tanks,varied with the rainfall. It was greatest when rainfall was scant,and least when the rams were copious."

It must be recognized that a guide such as this cannot be all inclusive and it is impossible to list all hazards for every job on the area. Its principal value is identification of the most potentially dangerous job hazards, and the inclusion of information to help workers avoid these hazards when encountered. As new job hazards are identified, they will be listed within. A continual effort will be made to minimize and eliminate hazards on all jobs. The foundation of our safety program is related to the safety attitude of its employees. The maintenance of a positive attitude toward safety by all employees will help this station maintain an excellent safety record.

Introduction    The Human Capital Project is one of three projects under the second compact, and it focuses on improving the quality of education and achieving a better match between the supply of skills and the demands of the labor market as they pertain to the international trade of goods and services in El Salvador. The Human Capital Project consists of two activities: (1) the Education Quality Activity, which is intended to improve the quality of the national education system; and (2) the Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) System Reform Activity. The TVET System Reform Activity, with funding of nearly $15 million, is intended to enhance its capacity to harmonize the skills supplied through education and training providers with the skills demanded by the labor market.     MCC contracted with Mathematica to conduct an evaluation of the activities under the Human Capital Project, including the TVET System Reform Activity. Mathematica will conduct a performance evaluation of the TVET System Reform Activity to document its implementation and assess how successful the project was at achieving the intended outcomes. Lessons learned through this performance evaluation will be useful for stakeholders as they continue improving the TVET system, and to inform decisions about the potential expansion of the reform activities to other sectors beyond the sectors focalized by FOMILENIO II.  II. Overview of the Technical  Education and Professional Training System  (TEPT) Activity The revised implementation of this Activity encompasses two main sub activities:     1. Integrated Technical Education and Professional Training Systems Sub-Activity: The revised implementation plan for this sub-activity includes two strategies:         a. Capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. The capacity building strategy has two goals: the first is to enable the private and public sector to identify and manage demands for technical education and professional training. The second is to enable public sector stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of education and training programs to respond quickly and efficiently to private sector labor market demands.     b. Strengthen the link between the supply and demand of technical education and professional training  through the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of information within and between productive sectors , and between private and public institutions in all productive sectors. FOMILENIO II will support the development of sectoral diagnostics to identify the needs of the productive sector, and improve the match between the industries and the training offerings in specified geographic areas. The following are the main tasks for implementing this strategy: 1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; 2) design or update three optional modules of the BTVs with input from the Sectoral Committees; and 3) Establish agreements between companies from the productive sectors and MINED to offer internships for students.    2. Continuous Labor Demand Assessment Sub-Activity. Two strategies encompass the implementation of this sub-activity: 1) establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework; and 2) strengthen the labor market observatory, integrating existing efforts to track labor market conditions.  III. Logic Model    The TEPT Activity in El Salvador is designed to link activities in the systems of technical education and professional training to the needs of the labor market in order to close the gap between training and employment. To that end, TEPT activities are largely focused on facilitating the exchange of information between the supply side and the demand side, both within and between productive sectors. The theory of change behind the implementation of the TEPT Activity states that all of its outputs will increase companies' productivity, and thereby improve workers' wages as well as the employability and socioeconomic standing of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.    1. Activities    The TEPT Activity funded by FOMILENIO II aims to strengthen capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. To that end, this strategy includes (1) creating sectoral committees for technical and educational training, and creating a Sectoral Committee Board to consolidate the demand for professional development in the private sector; (2) offering professional training to workers in the different industrial sectors under the competency-based approach; (3) designing models for certifying workers by competencies and accrediting institutions; (4) creating a Coordination Council of Technical Education and Professional Training to facilitate coordination between public and private organizations involved in technical and professional training, and align the offerings to the skills demanded in the labor market; and (5) establishing procedures and regulations to strengthen the institutional capacity to meet the private sector's demand for technical education and professional training. Implementation of the TEPT Activity includes the design of a roadmap for creating a national qualifications framework, and the development of an information system for the Coordination Council and other bodies to use in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the TEPT Activity.    The TEPT activity also seeks to improve the link between labor demand in the productive sectors with the availability of technical education and vocational training. To achieve this goal, FOMILENIO II plans to: (1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; (2) design at least three modules for the Vocational Technical Baccalaureate in coordination with the Sectoral Committees; and (3) establish agreements between companies from the sectors and MINEDUCYT to offer internships for students.     2. Short- and medium-term outcomes    Once the sectoral committees and the Board of Sectoral Committees are in existence, and a model for certification and accreditation has been implemented, the private sector will improve its capacity to identify and influence the professional training that is available to prospective trainees. Designing modules for the Professional Technical Baccalaureate, and creating the Coordination Council of TEPT will also improve the linkage between the demands of the productive sector, and the availability of technical education and vocational training.     3. Long-term outcomes    In the long term, the TEPT Activity is expected to improve the government's capacity to plan and evaluate the offer of technical education and professional training assisted by the MNC and the information system developed for subsequent planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the improved match between labor demand in the industrial/private sectors and the technical training available to the potential workforce will improve the productivity of companies, and therefore increase workers' wages. It is also expected to improve the employability of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.  IV. Evaluation design    The aims of the performance evaluation are to (1) assess progress toward the short- and medium-term outcomes that the program was designed to achieve and (2) understand and document the implementation of the Technical Education and Professional Training activities. To meet these two overarching aims, the performance evaluation will include a pre-post analysis of program outcomes and an implementation study.    A. Pre-post design.    The single group pre-post design consists of obtaining data for the outcomes of interest prior to (or at the beginning of) TEPT training (pre) and the same measure after participation in the TEPT courses (post). The pre-post study will focus on measuring the changes on labor market outcomes, and assessing to what extent work conditions, wages, and employment status improved for those who participated in the TEPT programs.     B. Implementation study     The implementation study will focus on describing all components of the TEPT program and their operation and identifying progress towards short- and medium-term outcomes of the program. We will document how program components were implemented, explore the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation of TEPT sub-activities, and describe the main program outputs of the TEPT System. We will also identify short- and long-term achievements and sustainability efforts related to each TEPT sub-activity.  V. Evaluation research questions    The pre-post study will focus on three descriptive research questions:    1. Did employee work conditions, benefits or non-wage compensation, change for trainees who participated in the TEPT courses approximately six to nine months after the courses ended?     2. Did wages change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    3. Did employment status change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    We will examine five main overarching research questions through the implementation study:    1. How were the TEPT sub-activities implemented, and what were the major facilitators and barriers to implementation?    2. Were some sectors more successful implementing the TEPT activities than others?    3. Which outputs were accomplished for each sub-activity, and to what extent did they meet the targets?     4. Which short- and long-term outcomes were accomplished for each sub-activity?     5. What are the plans for the institutional and financial sustainability of the services offered and the entities created as part of the TEPT activity?  VI. Data sources and analysis plan    A. Pre-post study:     Data sources.     The primary data source for the performance evaluation will be the trainee tracer survey. In collaboration with FOMILENIO II, we will field the pre-training tracer survey (baseline) with about 500 participants who are enrolled in TEPT courses, either prior to or within one month of their course initiation. TEPT courses will be rolled out starting the second quarter of 2019. Because the timing for the rollout will vary, baseline data collection will take place on a rolling basis and will be aligned with the course rollout plan for the prioritized sectors. We plan to conduct the baseline survey as a Computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ) with groups of enrolled trainees at their training sites and the follow-up survey as an individual, face-to-face, computer-administered questionnaire at respondents' work sites or homes. We will collect the follow-up survey six to nine months after the course ends by following a staggered timeline similar to the baseline data collection. The follow-up survey is expected to start in mid-2020 and to extend beyond the compact period.     Analyses.     To assess changes in work conditions, wages, and employment status sometime after participants should have completed the TEPT training programs, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the tracer survey data for trainees in FOMILENIO II-supported courses. We will compare key outcome indicators at baseline and follow-up for each trainee-level outcome and report averages (mean percent change) for the full sample of trainees and also by gender. We will also describe the background trainee characteristics, such as gender, age, and education level. The analysis will include a cross-sector comparison of participant characteristics and implementation milestones.    B. Implementation study    Data sources.     We will draw on three sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on outputs and achievements of the TEPT activity: (1) stakeholder interviews, (2) program monitoring data, and (3) a document review.     Analyses.     a. Analytic approach for quantitative program implementation data. We will conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on monitoring data to summarize the program outputs and understand short-term and long-term program achievements.    b. Analytic approach for qualitative program implementation data. We will prepare interview and focus group transcripts and conduct thematic analysis in two sequential steps. The first step involves conducting data reduction and mapping transcript segments to the core performance research questions. The second step involves thematic framing-the process of distilling themes and identifying patterns in qualitative data. We will develop a coding framework with a hierarchy of conceptual categories that are linked to the research questions and the program logic model. We will also create thematic memos for data synthesis and interpretation of key findings.     To take advantage of the complementarity that a mixed-methods approach affords, we will integrate findings from descriptive quantitative analysis of monitoring and administrative data with findings from qualitative data sources. We will summarize program outputs and outcomes from FOMILENIO II's administrative records and implementation reports by using data abstraction templates that we will design for this study. We will also create summary tables of qualitative findings from key stakeholder interviews. Then, we will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings by using triangulation techniques to (1) assess the consistency of the findings across methods and data sources, (2) confirm patterns of findings, and (3) identify potential discrepancies across data sources. Furthermore, information from the qualitative data collection related to barriers and facilitators to program implementation will help us interpret the findings from the quantitative analysis."

The main objective of the survey was to assess the current status of businesses in Lesotho, in relation to four principal factors, namely, water supply and sanitation, essential health services, investment climate in the country, land administration and modernization of the commercial legal system. The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%). In contrast, most jointly-owned enterprises had acquired plots through transfer from someone for cash (32.6%), followed by public sector agency grants (26.3%).  A significant proportion (69.8%) of enterprises did not have formally registered titles/documents to the premises that they used; The top reason for opting to rent/sublease business premises was not intending to acquire land, which was mentioned by 35.1 percent of enterprises. The second reason was of enterprises that did not qualify to hold land in Lesotho, which was mentioned by 23.2 percent of enterprises Majority (67.2 percent) of enterprises did not have occupational insurance. Over 50 percent of the enterprises did not have all the policies. Workers in 83.5 percent of all enterprises did not have access to a health and safety officer.  In 88.3 and 91.7 percent of all enterprises, workers did not have access to a counselor and services of a Social Worker, respectively. Workers in 32.6 percent of all enterprises did not have break hours.  As high as 86.4 percent of the enterprises lost between one (1) and 30 days to sick leave in the last twelve months. Majority of enterprises (84.5%) provided neither educational programmes/activities nor ARVs to their workforce."

Because of light-time delay and    other considerations, increased autonomy will be needed.    This will necessitate integration of tools in such areas as    anomaly detection, diagnosis, planning, and execution. In    this paper we investigate an approach that integrates planning    and execution by embedding planner-derived temporal    constraints in an execution procedure. To avoid the need for    propagation, we convert the temporal constraints to    dispatchable form. We handle some uncertainty in the    durations without it affecting the execution; larger variations    may cause activities to be skipped."

                "text": "Developing tools to eradicate ecologically destructive ants on Rose Atoll: effectiveness and attractiveness of formicidal baits A key factor contributing to the decline in the population of Pisonia grandis on Rose Atoll is an infestation of the non-native scale, Pulvinaria urbicola (Homoptera: Coccidae). Ants, in facultative relationships with scale insects, may facilitate scale population growth and increase their effect on plant hosts. Three ant species found on Rose Atoll, Tetramorium bicarinatum, T. simillimum, and Pheidole oceanica, are capable of tending Pulvinaria on Pisonia and may have contributed to the demise of the trees on the atoll. Replicated trials conducted on Rose Atoll during 17\u201321 March 2013 tested the effectiveness and relative attractiveness of five formicidal baits potentially to be used to eradicate these ants on the atoll. Three baits contained toxins (hydramethylnon in Amdro\u00ae and Maxforce\u00ae, indoxacarb in Provaunt\u00ae) and two baits contained an insect growth regulator (IGR; pyriproxyfen in Distance\u00ae and s-methoprene in Tango\u00ae). Amdro, Distance, and Maxforce are granular baits while Provaunt and Tango were mixed with adjuvants to form a gel-like matrix. Results varied among ant species and baits, but Provaunt was highly effective against workers of both Tetramorium species while Amdro and Maxforce were highly effective against T. simillimum and P. oceanica. Limited time on the island prevented the evaluation of the effectiveness of the IGR baits. The relative attractiveness of the baits generally mirrored their ability to kill worker ants. Tetramorium simillimum was attracted to all five baits; T. bicarinatum was attracted to Provaunt, Distance, and Tango; and P. oceanica was attracted to the three granular baits. These results and the small area of Rose Atoll suggest that island-wide application of formicidal baits may result in eradication of these ants, but an application strategy targeting all three species would more likely succeed with the use of multiple baits."

Its principal value is identification of the most potentially dangerous job hazards, and the inclusion of information to help workers avoid these hazards when encountered. As new job hazards are identified, they will be listed within. A continual effort will be made to minimize and eliminate hazards on all jobs. The foundation of our safety program is related to the safety attitude of its employees. The maintenance of a positive attitude toward safety by all employees will help this station maintain an excellent safety record. Supervisors and co-workers will provide the best incentive to new employees to perform duties in a proficient, efficient and safe manner."

We used a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) plug load management system to capture relevant data for two different types of multi-function devices (MFDs) in the facility, one of which was tested for use with different power settings. This enabled a quantitative analysis to assess impacts on energy consumption. It was found that a projected 65% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by using a newer, Energy Star compliant model of MFD, and an additional projected 39% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by subsequently changing the time-to-sleep for that MFD. It was also found that it may be beneficial to apply automated analysis with anomaly detection algorithms to detect problems with MFD performance, such as a failure to go to sleep mode or variations in sleep power draw. Furthermore, we observed that energy savings realized by using plug load management devices to de-energize (unplug) MFDs during non-business hours depends on the sleep power draw and time-to-sleep setting. For the MFDs in this study with settings established per the maintenance contract (which were different than factory default values), turning the device off at night and then on in the morning used more energy than leaving it on in sleep mode due to the start-up behavior and excessive time-to-sleep setting of four hours. From this and other assessments, we offer these recommendations to building occupants: reduce MFD time-to-sleep, encourage employees to use the power save button, and apply automated analysis to detect problems with device performance."

As of August 2016 a cumulative total of 4,000 acres (2,000 acres per year) of prairie dog colonies on Arapaho have been treated, 3,500 acres less than anticipated in the 2014 CRI proposal due to an overestimation of occupied white-tailed prairie dog acreage in North Park by Colorado Parks and Wildlife staff in 2012.  At this time the amount of occupied prairie dog habitat (2,732 acres) at Arapaho NWR and adjoining Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands is insufficient to support black-footed ferret reintroduction, but continued colony mapping in 2017-2019 may change this finding.  The portion of this project implemented at UL Bend NWR is nearly complete, with final data collection for the expanded sylvatic plague vaccine (SPV) field trials occurring through the end of August 2016, the 4th year of SPV efficacy evaluations.  These data will help evaluate SPV efficacy in a broader study led by USGS and other collaborators.  CRI funds were also used to purchase manufacturing equipment and to help develop the ability to mass produce more than 300,000 SPV  baits for treatments of more than 6,000 acres of prairie dogs in several western states.  CRI funds were also used to develop SPV bait dispensing abilities to enable realistic treatment of large areas of prairie dog with minimal time and expense, an effort that will continue into 2017."

Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) are a freshwater holarctic salmonid that were once widespread throughout the Upper Missouri River drainage as a glacial relict population. Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge encompasses nearly all of the currently occupied grayling spawning habitat within the Centennial Valley.   The estimated number of grayling in the 2018 Red Rock Creek spawning population was 387 (95% CI = 168\u2013682), nearly unchanged from the previous year ( \u02c6 N = 176, 95% CI = 159\u2013213). Suitable habitat the prior winter within Upper Lake (i.e., water depth below the ice \u2265 1 m and dissolved oxygen \u2265 4 ppm) reached a minimum during February sampling at an estimated 19 ha. This falls within a range of suitable winter habitat (i.e., 10\u201325 ha) previously hypothesized to lead to reduced grayling survival as documented in 2016. Area of winter habitat for the current year (2019) was estimated in January as 0 ha; 1995 was the only other year 0 ha of suitable winter habitat was estimated.  Suitable spawning habitat was quantified in 2017, with an estimated total area of suitable spawning habitat (Ats) of 0 ha, and weighted area of suitable habitat (Atw) of 4 ha, in Red Rock and Elk Springs creeks. Barriers precluding grayling from accessing suitable spawning habitat, i.e., beaver dams, were notched prior to spawning again in 2018 (similar to 2017) as part of the second hypothesis test of the Adaptive Management Plan. Hydrology during the 2018 breeding season critical period (i.e., peak spawning + 188 degree days + 5 weeks) was characterized using four variables related to stream flows (cubic feet second \u22121 [cfs]) and temperature (\u25e6C) \u2013 mean daily discharge (mdd    = 111.4 cfs), cumulative degree days from peak fry emergence to five weeks post-emergence (cdd = 364.2), days above bankfull discharge (cbf = 15), and days above 67% of bankfull discharge (c67bf = 38). These values represent 133%, 89%, 213%, and 186% of the long-term mean values for mdd, cdd, cbf, and c67bf, respectively."

One of the last endemic grayling populations remaining in the UMR drainage resides in the Centennial Valley (CV) of southwestern Montana. Spawning is largely limited to Red Rock, Corral, Elk Springs, and Odell creeks, with Red Rock Creek likely supporting 80-90% of annual spawning in the CV. It is presumed that most of the grayling population in the CV spends non-breeding portions of the year in Upper Red Rock Lake (Upper Lake).

                "text": "Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN), Markets, Submarkets, Sectors and Counties by Geographic Location The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides healthcare services to its veterans across the USA including territories and possessions. Healthcare services are delivered through 18 geographically divided administrative areas called Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN). Each VISN is divided into healthcare areas called Markets and Submarkets. Each Submarket is divided into Sectors and each Sector comprises one or more counties. In 1995 a process was created to coordinate and review the realignment of the Heath Care Networks. The Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) process established VISN 'subsets' called Markets, Submarkets and Sectors which, being smaller than VISNs, allowed for more precise analyses for greater access measurement to health care.    The County layer is the base geographic unit of the VISN-Market-Submarket-Sector-County hierarchy. The key attribute in this data set is the FIPS which is defined as a string of 5 characters with unique alphanumeric combinations for each site. The first 2 are the State FIPS code and the next 3 designate the County FIPS code. Example: '01031' is the FIPS for Coffee County, Alabama.    A Sector is a cluster of geographically adjacent counties within a VA Submarket. The process of aggregating counties into sectors uses a combination of automated algorithms and manual inspection of maps. The key attribute in this data set is the SECTOR which is defined as a string of eight characters broken down into four parts in the order of VISN (2-char), Market (1-char), Submarket (1-char), and Sector(1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example, Sector 12-a-3-A indicates VISN 12, Market a, Submarket 3 and Sector A.    Sub-markets reflect a clustering of the enrollee population within a market and are an aggregation of Sectors. The key attribute in this data set is the SUBMARKET which is defined as a string of six characters broken down in three parts in the order of VISN (2-char), Market (1-char), and Submarket (1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example, Submarket 12-a-3 indicates VISN 12, Market a, and Submarket 3.    CARES defines Markets as \"an aggregated geographic area having a sufficient population and geographic size to both benefit from the coordination and planning of health care services and to support a full healthcare delivery system (i.e. primary care, mental health care, inpatient care, tertiary care, and long term care)\". Each Market is built from Submarkets. The key attribute in this data set is the MARKET which is defined as a string of four characters broken down in two parts in the order of HCN (2-char) and Market (1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example, Market 12-a indicates VISN 12 and Market a.    The key attribute in the VISN data set is defined as a string of two characters from 01-23, excluding 3, 11, 13, 14 and 18; a VISN also has an officially recognized VA title. For example, VISN 06 is the Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network. VISNs can span across neighboring countries to include areas that are not contiguous. For example, VISN 08 includes Florida and Puerto Rico in addition to most of Florida and southern Georgia, and VISN 20 includes Alaska and parts of the northwest conterminous United States. Each VISN is built from Markets, Submarkets, Sectors and Counties derived from Census (2010) County data.    Because VISNs are composed of VHA markets, VISN boundaries align with the outer edges of their constituent markets\u2019 boundaries. Markets cross state borders wherever it is necessary to keep outpatient clinics (e.g. Community-Based Outpatient Clinics(CBOCs)) and their catchment areas in the same market as their parent medical centers. Thus, VISN boundaries also cross state borders. In 2016 senior leadership considered the challenge of conforming VISN boundaries to MyVA Districts, which coincide with state boundaries. It was agreed that VHA would not separate outpatient clinics from their parent medical centers due to added complexity. Many outpatient providers hold clinics at their mother facilities and clinics are on the same health record as their parent facilities. VISN and market maps created by VHA Policy and Planning conform to these principals and are the official maps for VHA VISNs and markets.    While the Planning Systems Support Group (PSSG) develops the feature classes depicting the various VHA geographies, the PSSG does not have the authority to modify or reorganize the boundaries. The boundaries are developed at higher levels of the VHA and passed to the PSSG to be translated into spatial features."

Specific Plot Design: Selection of specific sites will include those recently established by Dr. Karen Hughes (lead PI) at Twin Creeks (mixed burn), Baskins Creek Trail (mid to heavy burn), Balsom Point quiet walkway (mixed burn), Cove Hardwood Trail out of the Chimneys Picnic Area (mixed burn), yet to be established is the severe burn plots at Bullshead Trail and at severe burned heath area. Final plot establishment will be completed in April 2017 with guidance by Park Service personnel familiar with the fire severities at different sites in park. I will select the specific sites based on at least three treatments: control or health plots (4 replicate plots), lightly damaged sites (4 replicate plots) litter surface layer burned, and heavy or severe fire 4 replicate plots). This would account for 12 plots/forest type. I hope to locate two forest types to replicate the experiment and treatments. Levels of fire severity based on soil surface and sublayer damage will be defined in more detail before plots are established. Fire damaged plot areas will be measured for slope and aspect using four randomly selected points per area and averaged. Grids (subplots- 4 m \u00d7 4 m) will be established within 20 \u00d7 20 m plots to enable collections of fleshy fungi to assess and monitor sporophore formation of ectomycorrhizal (EMC), wood decay and possible parasitic soil fungi. For the Illumina Whole-Community Study, the soils are time=zero soils collected as part of the Nitrogen Mineralization measurements, at 0-10 cm depth from each of the 20 plots. First soil sampling will be completed in May, 2017 with another later during the same year to evaluate microbial recovery potential (October). The samples are composited soils from each plot, made up from 10 soil cores per plot; PVC cores are 4.8 cm diameter. Soils will be used for both nutrient analysis (total C, total N, pH, Ca, Mg, K, ECEC, % base saturation) and for microbial community analysis using next generation sequencing. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the soils for evaluating spatial distributions of below ground mycelium (eg stipitate hydnums) compared with data from sporophore formation following methods by Van der Linde et al. (2008). In addition, information on abiotic climatic factors will be recorded by a climate stations and macronutrients especially C and N (eg. total N) measurements will be collected from soil and forest floor N pools (Knoepp et al. 2008). Identification of fungi from soil samples: Sporophore forming ECM and other fungi will be characterized to species (as possible), as will species richness, diversity, and abundance (evenness) of each species using standard ecological methods (Baird et al. 2007, 2009). To identify species, community composition and abundance Illumina sequencing will be employed using primers concentration on ITS 2 gene region for sequencing. Potentially for each sample, Illumina sequencing can identify up to 1500 fungal species (Gihring et al. 2011). DNA will be extracted from these soil-litter samples using several protocol including Mo Bio Power\u00ae kits and CTAB as needed. The variable region ITS2 rDNA of fungi as stated above will be PCR amplified and analyzed using Illumina sequencing (Illumina Technology, Eurofin MWG). In order to reduce costs proven published strategies allowing multiple samples to be sequenced in a single tube will be used to identify fungi from soil-litter samples. Sporphore (mushroom) collections: Adjacent to each rhodendron (riparian) plot at each location, all sporophores present will be collected monthly over a three-year period (April-November) or 21 sampling dates for 2017 \u2013 2019. Collections will be made for all sporophores and documented as per 4 \u00d7 4 m subplot, and returned to laboratory for specimen labeling, photographic documentation, morphological data collection and dried for preservation and herbarium storage. Computation of fungal richness and diversity will be compared to nutrient data"

The river is home to many fish and wildlife species. Large multiple-use demands placed on the river, however, have contributed to a gradual degradation in water quality. Environmental contaminants and their effects on the river's fish and wildlife are currently being studied by researchers from the Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and the BEST (Biomonitoring Environmental Status and Trends) program. This research is being conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Fish .and Wildlife Service and other federal and state agencies and is designed to identify the types of contaminants present in the Willamette River, their sources, and possible adverse effects. Contaminants such as organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, furans, diphenyl ethers, and other pollutants are suspected of causing detrimental effects in several fish and wildlife species. In previous studies of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, environmental contaminants have been identified and quantified in river otter (Lontra canadensis) livers, bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) eggs, osprey (Pandion haliaetus) eggs, and fish (Henny et al. 1981, Anthony et al. 1993, Henny et al. 1996, Bucket al. 1999, Buck and Sproul1999, Kannan et al. 1999, Kannan et al. 2002, Henny et al. 2003, Buck et al. 2004, Henny et al. 2004, Villeneuve et al. 2004 ). The contaminants that correlated with declines in bald eagle productivity were associated with agricultural pesticides and industrial pollutants. Historically, pesticides such as DDT and its metabolites caused severe thinning of eggshells in bald eagles, double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), ospreys, and many other bird species which decreased productivity and ultimately reduced the size of some populations. Mink (Mustela vison) are among the most sensitive mammalian species to the toxic effects of dioxins, furans and PCBs dioxins, furans and PCBs (Hochstein et al. 1988), and have severely declined in numbers along the lower Columbia River (Henny et al. 1981). Understanding environmental contaminant origins, sources, concentrations, and possible effects on fish and wildlife is needed to protect fish and wildlife in the Willamette River aquatic ecosystem. The river otter is a top predator of most aquatic food chains that has adapted to a wide variety of aquatic habitats, from marine environments to high mountain lakes of North America (Toweill and Tabor 1982). Otters exhibit differing degrees of sociality and spacing based on habitat, shelter availability, and food abundance (Reid et al. 1994). Otter home ranges (approximately 11 river miles) are largely defined by local topography and overlap extensively within and between sexes, exhibiting varying degrees of mutual avoidance and tolerance depending on seasonal dispersion and availability of food and shelter (Reid et al. 1994). However, otter do maintain territories within home ranges that are delineated by scent marking and latrine sites. Areas within territories are used almost exclusively by the defending otter, excluding otters of the same sex (i.e., female otters exclude other females and family groups, while males exclude other males). Otters eat a wide variety of fish species and aquatic invertebrates such as crabs, crayfish and mussels. Thus, river otters are a good integrator of their aquatic environments and a useful surrogate species for determining both wildlife and human contaminant exposure and potential harmful effects."

The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum."

A total of 163 fungal collections were made. Of this total, 130 collections were basidiomycetes; 21 collections were ascomycetes; 11 were asco- and basidiolichens; and 1 was a myxomycete. The period from 22 August to 26 August, 1975, was spent on Adak where 51 collections were made, and of those 36 were basidiomycetes and 13 were ascomycetes. From 26 August to 2 September, 1975, collecting was restricted to Amchitka where 112 collections were made, and of these 94 were basidiomycetes, 8 were ascomycetes and 10 were lichens. The fungi, in total, represented 33 genera in 17 families of basidiomycetes, 5 genera in 4 families of ascomycetes and 1 myxomycete. Three species of imperfect fungi have been isolated from hair grass. Deschampsia sp., and are being cultured for study. Collections of higher fungi were made from several habitats on Adak and from all three topoenvironments on Amchitka. Fungi found on Amchitka were most commonly associated with the transitional region between lowland and upland crowberry-sedge and crowberry-grass-sedge communities. One truly mycorrhizal species, in the genus Russula, was found on Amchitka. All other fungi were thought to be saprobic decomposers. The genera composite represented a late spring and summer flora common to lower latitudes. The maritime tundra mycoflora was distinct and showed almost no similarity to the mycoflora of the Arctic tundra."

In 2010 Pheasants Forever Inc., acting as a conservation buyer purchased a 2,700 tract of land owned by the Joe Marty family.  This acquisition allows Camas NWR (10,500 acres) to now be connected with Mud Lake State Wildlife Management Area (8,853 acres).  This connection allows the State of Idaho and FWS the opportunity to manage a larger tract of wildlife habitat in coordination.  Much of the Pheasants Forever Inc. tract had been abused by over grazing of cattle and horses.  This has led to a serious invasion of Russian knapweed which has gained a strong hold on the landscape.  Canada thistle, musk thistle, white top, black henbane and leafy spurge are also present on all three tracts.  Funds from this grant helped implement three measures (mapping, biological controls and chemical) to control the invasive plants on all three properties. Three main cooperating agencies have spent time and resources treating invasive species on this newly acquired land.  These agencies or groups are:  Idaho Fish and Game Department, USFWS, and the Continental Divide Weed Management Area group and its partners (for a complete list of partners see the partnership section of this document)."

Instead of a onetime sample as described in the RBPs, four monthly samples each of fish and macroinvertebrates were collected from June through October 1995. Samples were collected in shorter sections of stream than prescribed in the RBPs. Statistical analysis of the data indicated degraded conditions downstream of the Weyerhauser and Dominance sites, with mixed results at the Tyson site. Some seasonal variability in the RBP metrics over time, suggest that a one-time sample may not provide a complete picture of community health of fish and macroinvertebrates in a study stream."

An estimated 2700 - 3200 swans, including 700 - 760 nesting pairs summered on the refuge, compared to 9100 swans estimated on the refuge and its coastal environs during mid-September staging. Summering locations for the majority of the staging population were unknown; however abundant Potamogeton spp. availability in Kobuk Lake may have been an attractant. In 1984 breeding swan density was higher on the Selawik flats as compared to the Kobuk River delta, opposite to the pattern observed in 1983. The reversal may have been due to a shift in favorability of the two sites, perhaps related to the late breakup on the more coastal Kobuk delta area in 1984. Overall breeding population was slightly higher in 1984 but production was slightly lower in 1984, 1081 cygnets as compared to 1277 cygnets in 1983. Local movement data from radio instrumented family groups revealed two staging patterns: (1) remain in brood-rearing area and migrate west to coastal area near Kobuk Lake/Selawik Lake followed by migration to east or (2) remain in brood-rearing area and migrate directly east without staging movement. Both Kobuk delta-radioed family groups remained within a 3 km radius of their capture area followed by movement to the Kobuk Lake coastal area and departure to east. Three of 4 Selawik flats-radioed family groups remained within a 3 km radius of capture area then migrated east, whereas one family group first moved to the coastal Kobuk Lake area before migrating east."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - MECB Grantee Approximately 6,000 households in Jack compound, a peri-urban community in Lusaka, Zambia rely on Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) for their water provision. LWSC struggles to meet this demand due to its decaying water distribution infrastructures and intermittent cuts to electricity.  Therefore, water accessibility and quality are major challenges in the compound, burdening residents with unproductive time usage (mostly on women who are forced to wait in long queues to fetch water), decreasing water accountability, increasing residents' risk of water-borne diseases and forcing them to turn to private water vendors.                    As a response to these challenges, MECB formed a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with LWSC to implement MECB's Smart Safe Water Supply Scheme-Scaling Up (SSWS-SU) project. It aims to address these challenges by digging \u201chigh yield\u201d boreholes to increase the amount of water to be pumped, by installing solar pumps to enable 24/7 availability of water, by rehabilitating the existing water distribution piping system and by installing new water kiosks with an innovative dispensing machine that works with unique non-cash tokens to help ensure accountability.  The purpose of the performance evaluation of MECB's Smart Safe Water Scheme Scaling Up (SSWS-SU) Project is to examine how SSWS-SU is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are: (1) to increase access to potable water in Jack compound, (2) to increase time savings through shorter wait times at water kiosks, (3) to increase transparency and equity of water fees, and (4) to increase water revenue.Initial conditions of water access and water use in Jack compound, project implementation, activities, and outputs are also examined to understand the performance and dynamics of the SSWS-SU project. AIR used a qualitative methodological approach to investigate the fidelity of project implementatiion and the ways in which deviations in implementation affected expected project outputs. We also explored changes in key outcomes of interest (e.g., increased access to potable water, shorter wait times at water kiosks, etc.), although the outcome analysis was descriptive rather than causal. This baseline evaluation report provides results on program implementation and performance prior to the commencement of water distribution by MECB. In addition, the evaluation aims to documnet lessons learned and best practices related to the implementation of water distribution projects and the efficacy of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in water management.   The research questions driving thsi evaluation fall into three main areas: (1) the enabling environment (2) the implementation process (3) sustainability.                                                                                                                                     Research questions per each evaluation area are:     Area 1: Enabling Environment     A. Public Private Partnerships    \u00b7   Who are the relevant actors and/or organizations that shape access to water in Jack compound? How do these actors and/or organizations impact how residents access water?     \u00b7   How did MECB establish its partnership with LWSC? How, if at all, did MECB work with other key actors relevant to water access in Jack to establish the project? What challenges, if any, did MECB face in securing this/these partnership(s) and how were they resolved?    B. Access to Water and Usage Behaviors    \u00b7   From where do select Jack residents get their water at baseline? How do Jack residents initially perceive water accessibility, affordability, and reliability? How do residents perceive access for    the most vulnerable (e.g.,those who are physically disabled or those in low socio-economic status households)?     \u00b7   What are the perceptions of water quality at baseline?    \u00b7   What are the costs associated with transporting the water from the MECB kiosk to homes for select residents?    \u00b7   How do households transport, handle, and store water at baseline?     \u00b7   For households with private taps, how is water distributed/sold among family friends, neighbours, and other residents?     \u00b7   What are the water usage patterns and/or behaviors of select Jack residents at baseline?     Area 2: Implementation Process    A. Token System    \u00b7   At baseline, what are the anticipated outcomes of the token system among respondents? What are respondents' perceptions and recommendations for improvement of the token system at baseline? What are respondents' perceptions of the sustainability of the token system at baseline?     B. Implementation Challenges     \u00b7   How, if at all, did the implementation process differ from the original plan proposed by MECB (in the IGP grant contract)? \u00b7   Are there any unintended consequences of the SSWS-SU project within Jack compound?     Area 3: Sustainability \u00b7   How does MECB plan to shift maintenance responsibilities to residents of Jack compound? Is this plan feasible? Why or why not? \u00b7   Does MECB think that the revenue sharing agreement with LWSC is economically viable? Why or why not? How do MECB and LWSC view the sustainability of the private commercial provision of water?  Summary  (purpose, nature, scope, special content characteristics) of different areas of evaluation:     The evaluation questions were investigated using several qualitative methods, including an actor mapping exercise with SSWS-SU stakeholders, key informant interviews (KIIs) with MECB and LWSC officials, other relevant officials, and water providers, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with Jack residents. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official project documents obtained from MECB and Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).    The evaluation of the enabling environment aims to establish a deep understanding of the initial conditions and enabling environment of Jack compound to inform MECB's program activities and prospects for sustainability. The evaluation of the implementation process provides a preliminary analysis of MECB's implementation of the SSWS-SU project. An assessment of Jack residents' perceptions of SSWS-SU's new token system will help identify the challenges and facilitators to residents' potential uptake. Further, this area evaluation provides an overview of the implementation challenges that MECB faced while constructing the project's physical infrastructure, sensitizing the Jack community, and mitigating the potential social and environmental risks of the intervention. The last area of evaluation, sustainability assesses the feasibility of MECB's strategy to ensure the SSWS-SU project's sustainability. We examine the extent to which MECB has built community buy-in and ownership over the project's assets and operations and also assess the revenue sharing agreement between MECB and LWSC, and finally also assess whether the PPP is built upon a sustainable economic model.   Summary (purpose, nature, scope, special content characteristics) of data collection:     1. Actor Mapping: Actor maps are \"visual depiction[S] of key organizations and/or individuals that make up and/or influence a system, as well as their relationships to a given issue and to one another.\"  This was conducted to better understand the relevant actors in the local water sector, their relationships to one another, their interests and their broader influence in shaping water disbursement processes within Jack compound.     2. KIIs: KIIs with different individuals were conducted to gather information on different research questions.     \u00b7   KII with MCA-Z staff focused on implementation challenges and successes, the process of engaging local stakeholders, institutional and political structures and support and program sustainability.    \u00b7   KII with MECB staff focused on the planning and initial implementation process including the main challenges encountered, how MECB overcame these challenges, its process of engaging local partners, and the perceived sustainability of its PPP with LWSC.     \u00b7   KIIs with LWSC officials focused on the nature of LWSC's collaboration with MECB including its initial discussions, staff perspectives on the PPP model, LWSC's current role and mode of engaging with MECB during implementation, challenges and successes throughout implementation, and LWSC's thoughts on the most feasible plans for sustaining this initiative.     \u00b7   KII with NWASCO focused on issues related to water access, quality, affordability, as well as residents' collection and usage patterns. AIR also inquired about PBOs perceptions and expectations regarding the SSWS-SU project and the potential implications it might bring to their businesses.     \u00b7   KIIs with private borehole owners (PBOs) focused on issues related to water access, quality, affordability, as well as residents' collection and usage patterns. AIR also inquired about PBOs perceptions and expectations regarding the SSWS-SU project and the potential implications it might bring to their businesses.     \u00b7   KIIs with community leaders focused on how the community might be affected by the SSWS-SU project's innovations. Specifically, we asked community leaders to provide their perspective on past and current water quality, community level factors that might shape project implementation, and their thoughts on SSWS-SU's prospects for sustainability.     3.  FGDs: This was conducted to understand Jack residents' WASH related perceptions and behaviours at baseline and to gauge their level of sensitization regarding the SSWS-SU project. The FGDs with residents enabled AIR to examine similarities and differences among residents who fetch and use water from different sources and how these choices might affect their perceptions about water accessibility and quality."

The survey was implemented in six regions including the North Atlantic, MidAtlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, West Coast, and Alaska. This report, Volume I, presents the survey results at the national scale only. The survey was developed through a collaborative process that underwent extensive reviews by NOAA Fisheries\u2019 economists, NOAA Fisheries\u2019 regional recreational coordinators and by key recreational fishing stakeholder groups. The survey was also tested with four focus groups. Following these reviews and testing, the survey was approved for an information collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Surveys were administered using a mail survey and followed the Modified Dillman Method (Dillman 2007). Overall, a total of 33,673 anglers were recruited for the survey; just over 27% (9,200) returned a completed survey. Response rates were highest in the North Atlantic region (38.3%) and lowest in the Gulf of Mexico (21.1%). On average, respondents have participated in recreational saltwater fishing for 28 years, and fished 25 days during the last year. The majority of the respondents fish from a private boat within three miles of shore; however, most trips were taken from a shore mode, including beaches, piers or bridges. The vast majority of respondents stated that they would not decrease their number of fishing trips in the following year. For the majority of those who would reduce their trips, it would be for financial reasons. Anglers responding to the survey usually used friends and family as sources of information about fishing. Spending time with family friends is an important part of a fishing trip, but catching fish and fishing in uncongested areas are also important to anglers. Anglers who anticipated they would fish less in the coming year did not primarily identify fishing regulations as the cause, but rather most frequently cited financial considerations and lack of leisure time as the likely causes of decreased fishing trips. Broadly, anglers think that the most important recreational fisheries management objectives should be: providing high quality fishing opportunities for future generations, providing different types of fish, and providing large quantities of fish. Anglers also want federal and state agencies to have consistent and simple regulations. While providing substantial numbers of fish to catch and providing species diversity were rated as important for most anglers, only about half of the respondents were satisfied with how recreational fisheries management addresses these issues. The most important management strategies that recreational fisheries should focus upon are: providing enough fish for recreational fishermen, incorporating stakeholder interests in the policy process, and monitoring and enforcing recreational fishing regulations. When designing specific management regulations, anglers tended to prefer management measures such as restoring habitat, establishing minimum size limits, and providing artificial habitat."

Measurement of noticeable results at the end of the Compact, including effects and impacts (both positive and negative, expected or unexpected) on beneficiaries, institutions, project governance, and the environment, as well as the perceived change among stakeholders, including community members in the project areas, regarding the project itself and the results achieved.         Analysis of the degree to which project mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented, to see if they affected project performance.    The evaluation will also make recommendations for strengthening and capitalizing on project results and draw lessons to build upon during the design and implementation phase of similar projects in the future.  Extension Project:    The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \"Extension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.  The approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.  The impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:   The Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.  The ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively.   Due lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  -At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.    -While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.    -During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually."

Additionally, ESI maps can be used by planners--before a spill happens--to identify vulnerable locations, establish protection priorities, and identify cleanup strategies.  Shoreline rankings rate how sensitive an area of shoreline would be to an oil spill. The ranking scale goes from 1 to 10. A rank of 1 represents shorelines with the least susceptibility to damage by oiling. Examples include steep, exposed rocky cliffs and banks. The oil cannot penetrate into the rock and will be washed off quickly by the waves and tides. A rank of 10 represents shorelines most likely to be damaged by oiling. Examples include protected, vegetated wetlands, such as mangrove swamps and saltwater marshes. Oil in these areas will remain for a long period of time, penetrate deeply into the substrate, and inflict damage to many kinds of plants and animals.

In addition, within the T&D intervention group, we randomly assigned some communities to receive the financing scheme (FS) initiative. To assess impacts of the FS initiative, we compared outcomes of households in the randomly selected treatment communities with those of households in the control communities, adjusting for baseline characteristics. The key research questions we addressed were: (1) What are the impacts of being in communities selected to receive lines through the T&D activity? (2) What are the impacts of being in communities selected to receive low-cost connections through the FS initiative? (3) What are the impacts of being connected to the national grid? (4) Do the impacts vary by gender, age, income, or urbanicity?   Both the T&D analysis and the FS analysis utilize data from a baseline survey (conducted in 2011) and from a follow-up survey (conducted in 2015). The follow-up data are provided in this package. Key findings from the final evaluation include the following:  \u00b7   The T&D activity led to a large number of new connections, but it was less than a third of the 35,000 connections assumed at the outset.    \u00b7   The FS initiative also increased connection rates, but even if all T&D communities received low-cost connections, the number of connections originally assumed would still have not been achieved.     \u00b7   The T&D activity, FS initiative, and connection to the grid increased consumption of grid electricity, ownership of electric tools, time spent watching television, and perceived household safety.    \u00b7   The T&D activity increased the percentage of households doing an income-generating activity (IGA) that used grid electricity.    \u00b7   The FS initiative reduced poverty as measured by per capita consumption under $1 or $2 per day.     \u00b7   Being connected increased children's hours of studying at night, but it increased TV watching much more; being connected also increased income and reduced poverty.

                "text": "Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study Introduction    Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.    Experimental Design    A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.    Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.    The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Methods    Vegetation and Soil Measurements    Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs (\uf03e 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide \u00d7 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm \u00d7 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.    Rainfall Simulations    Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105\u00b0C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).    Overland Flow Simulations    Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105\u00b0C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).    Resulting Data    The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.    Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center. This dataset is contribution number 134 of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project."

Additional enhancements for this new version of the product include: 1) The V5.0 (end-of mission) version of Aquarius Level-2 (swath) SSS data are used as input data for the OI SSS analysis. 2) The source of the first guess fields has changed from the APDRC Argo-derived SSS product to the average of four different in-situ based SSS products. 3) The bias correction algorithm has changed to adjust SSS retrievals for large-scale systematic biases on a repeat-track basis. 4) New, less restrictive thresholds are implemented to filter observations for land and ice contamination, thus improving coverage in the coastal areas and semi-enclosed seas. 5) Level-2 RFI masks for descending and ascending satellite passes  are used to discard observations in specific geographic zones where excessive ascending-descending differences are observed due to contamination from undetected RFI. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit. Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity. The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath. The Aquarius polar orbit is sun synchronous at 657 km with a 6 pm, ascending node, and has a 7-Day repeat cycle."

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.    Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).    REFERENCES    1.

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.    REFERENCES    1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

The metrics of range size and local abundance reflect aspects of the biology and ecology of a given species, and together with its per capita (or per unit area) effects on other members of the community comprise a well-accepted theoretical paradigm describing invasive species. Although these metrics are readily calculated from vegetation monitoring data, they have not generally (and effect in particular) been applied to native species. We describe how metrics defining invasions may be more broadly applied to both native and invasive species in vegetation management, supporting their relevance to local scales of species conservation and management. We then use a sample monitoring dataset to compare range size, local abundance and effect as well as summary calculations of landscape penetration (range size \u00d7 local abundance) and impact (landscape penetration \u00d7 effect) for native and invasive species in the mixed-grass plant community of western North Dakota, USA. This paper uses these summary statistics to quantify the impact for 13 of 56 commonly encountered species, with statistical support for effects of 6 of the 13 species. Our results agree with knowledge of invasion severity and natural history of native species in the region. We contend that when managers are using invasion metrics in monitoring, extending them to common native species is biologically and ecologically informative, with little additional investment."

Snow storms during late August stimulated strong southeasterlv movements of caribou from Alaska, however, caribou drifted back north during mild weather in September. Some caribou returned to Alaska during late fall (October) movements. At the onset of winter conditions (November), large numbers of caribou were located in the northern Richardson Mountains in Canada where thev remained during the winter of 1984-1985. Rased on proportions of radio-collared caribou found, it is estimated that about 50,000 caribou wintered on traditional ranges in Alaska and about 90,000 caribou wintered in the northern Richardson Mountains and Yukon north slope in Canada. First year mortalitv (based on survival rates of radio-collared calves) was estimated at 3R% for 1984-1985. Male calves had a higher first year mort ali tv rate (53%) than female calves ( 23%). Annual mortality of (1-3 year old) radio-collared caribou (5%) was significantly lower than that for adults older than 3 years (32%). Following a brief period of; higher mortality immediately after parturition, calves survived well until fall, when detected mortality again increased. Overwinter mortality of radio-collared calves was low. This pattern was similar to that identified for the 1983 calf cohort."

This ranking system serves as a first step for land managers to prioritize areas for check-dam installation based on relatively static factors (soil properties, topography, and hydrology) that can contribute to rates of soil erosion by water and the stability of check-dams. Many other relatively dynamic factors over time can contribute to rates of soil erosion by water, such as recent wildfire events, changes in weather patterns and extreme climate events, and changing land-use such as grazing, logging, mining, development, and cultivation. These factors that influence vegetative and biological soil crusts cover are also important elements to the potential erosion of soil by water. Because of this, SRLCC stakeholders might consider further evaluation of the watersheds identified here as high ranking. Final watershed prioritization among the high-ranking watersheds identified here should include current knowledge of land-use and land-cover estimates to identify areas at risk for soil erosion or degree of existing erosion problems."

DEFINITIONS    Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.    Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.    Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.    NOTES    Data on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).    Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.    Hierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).    The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that    1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,    where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).    County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).    SOURCES    National Center for Health Statistics.

                "text": "Daily Weather Records These daily weather records were compiled from a subset of stations in the Global Historical Climatological Network (GHCN)-Daily dataset. A weather record is considered broken if the value exceeds the maximum (or minimum) value recorded for an eligible station. A weather record is considered tied if the value is the same as the maximum (or minimum) value recorded for an eligible station. Daily weather parameters include Highest Min/Max Temperature, Lowest Min/Max Temperature, Highest Precipitation, Highest Snowfall and Highest Snow Depth. All stations meet defined eligibility criteria. For this application, a station is defined as the complete daily weather records at a particular location, having a unique identifier in the GHCN-Daily dataset. For a station to be considered for any weather parameter, it must have a minimum of 30 years of data with more than 182 days complete in each year. This is effectively a 30-year record of service requirement, but allows for inclusion of some stations which routinely shut down during certain seasons. Small station moves, such as a move from one property to an adjacent property, may occur within a station history. However, larger moves, such as a station moving from downtown to the city airport, generally result in the commissioning of a new station identifier. This tool treats each of these histories as a different station. In this way, it does not thread the separate histories into one record for a city. Records Timescales are characterized in three ways. In order of increasing noteworthiness, they are Daily Records, Monthly Records and All Time Records. For a given station, Daily Records refers to the specific calendar day: (e.g., the value recorded on March 7th compared to every other March 7th). Monthly Records exceed all values observed within the specified month (e.g., the value recorded on March 7th compared to all values recorded in every March). All-Time Records exceed the record of all observations, for any date, in a station's period of record. The Date Range and Location features are used to define the time and location ranges which are of interest to the user. For example, selecting a date range of March 1, 2012 through March 15, 2012 will return a list of records broken or tied on those 15 days. The Location Category and Country menus allow the user to define the geographic extent of the records of interest. For example, selecting Oklahoma will narrow the returned list of records to those that occurred in the state of Oklahoma, USA. The number of records broken for several recent periods is summarized in the table and updated daily. Due to late-arriving data, the number of recent records is likely underrepresented in all categories, but the ratio of records (warm to cold, for example) should be a fairly strong estimate of a final outcome. There are many more precipitation stations than temperature stations, so the raw number of precipitation records will likely exceed the number of temperature records in most climatic situations."

Users should not use this version except in rare cases (e.g., when reproducing previous studies that used this version). The Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset addresses the need for historical daily records over global land areas. Like its monthly counterpart (GHCN-Monthly), GHCN-Daily is a composite of climate records from numerous sources that were merged and then subjected to a suite of quality assurance reviews. The meteorological elements measured for the data set include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, precipitation (i.e., rainfall and snow water equivalent), snowfall and snow depth. GHCN-Daily serves as the official archive for daily data from the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Surface Network (GSN) and is particularly well suited for monitoring and assessment activities related to the frequency and magnitude of extremes. Sources for the GHCN-Daily data set include, but are not limited, to U.S. Cooperative Summary of the Day, U.S. Fort data, U.S. Climate Reference Network, Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network, and numerous international sources. The dataset contains measurements from over 75,000 stations worldwide,about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Approximately 8500 are regularly updated with observations from within the last month. While most of these sites report precipitation, daily maximum and minimum temperatures are available at more than 25,000 of them, and over 24,000 contain records of snowfall and/or snow depth. The process of integrating data from multiple sources into the GHCN-Daily dataset takes place in three steps: screening the source data for stations whose identity is unknown or questionable; classifying each station in a source dataset either as one that is already represented in GHCN-Daily or as a new site; and mingling the data from the different sources. The first two of these steps are performed whenever a new source dataset or additional stations become available, while the actual mingling of data is part of the automated processing that creates GHCN-Daily on a regular basis. GHCN-Daily data are subject to a suite of quality assurance checks. The checks consist of several types of carefully evaluated tests that detect duplicated data, climatological outliers, and various inconsistencies (internal, temporal, and spatial). Manual review of random samples of flagged values was used to set the threshold for each procedure such that the tests false-positive rate is minimized. In addition, the tests are performed in a deliberate sequence in an effort to enhance the performance of the later checks by detecting errors with the checks applied earlier in the sequence."

Ninety study plots were established on seismic lines and camp moves in tussock tundra and moist sedge-shrub tundra. Total snow depth and its components, slab layer and depth hoar, were measured during the winter. Plant cover changes, tussock disturbance, visibility and disturbance levels were determined at the study plots in the summer. Disturbance was found to be generally lower when snow depths were greater. In tussock tundra, plots with snow depths over 25 em had significantly less disturbance than those with under 25 em (p < 0.05). The relationship between snow cover and disturbance was less clear in moist sedge-shrub tundra, where disturbance appeared to be less at snow depths above 25 em, but these differences were not statistically significant (p < 0.05). Slab depth, which does not include the loose layer of depth hoar, provided a better measure of protective snow cover in moist sedge-shrub tundra, as slab depths over 20 em resulted in significantly less disturbance (p < 0.05). Moderate-level disturbance (25-50 o/o decrease in plant cover) did not occur on trails where snow depths were at least 25 em in tussock tundra and 35 em in moist sedge-shrub tundra. Low-level disturbances (less than 25 o/o decrease in plant cover) occurred on trails with snow depths as high as 45 em in tussock tundra and 72 em in moist sedge-shrub tundra."

                "text": "Terrain and coastal condition on the Arctic Alaska coastal plain This group of four reports describes the characteristics and seasonal variation of prominent relief features on and along the margin of the arctic coastal plain. These relief features include polygonal ground patterns, lake scarps and coastal features. The range of polygonal ground patterns commonly found is illustrated by a number of transects. The influence of the seasonal snow cover on relief is indicated by profiles taken during the summer and the winter. The winter profiles were taken during the period of maximum snow accumulation. The subduing influence of the seasonal snowpack is much more apparent in areas of high relief. Irregularities in the snow surface may approach those found in the more featureless areas of summer relief. A discussion of properties of the snow cover is also included from observations in the Barrow study area. Constant reworking by the wind of small amounts of snow results in a snow surface with high bearing capacity and low (  0.5 m and seldom exceeding 1.0 m with 1.5 m being the practical upper limit cover 10.7% of the area. The remainder of the study area can be grouped into two general categories: 1) 53% with polygonal ground relief less than 0.5 m, and 2) 36% containing all other relief categories, including water surfaces. The study of coastal processes and relief features along the northern Alaskan coast was in part based on maps and aerial photos. Mean coastal relief or sea-cliff height was approximately 3.9 m, with about 75% of the coast having 5 m or less relief. Profiles from the Barrow area reveal that the surface geometry of the coast is dramatically altered by the seasonal windblown snow cover which tends to ramp the sea cliffs. The frequency of gullies, streams, embayed rivers and drowned thaw lakes along the coast was examined since they provide \"windows\" through the scarp and access to inland areas. There are approximately 800 windows along this coast or about 0.4 per km, with a mean width of about 200 m and mean inland extent of .4 km."

The Johnston Draw watershed (1.8 km2), ranging from 1497 \u2013 1869 m in elevation, is a sub-watershed of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho. The dataset includes continuous hourly hydrometeorological variables across a 372 m elevation gradient, on north- and south-facing slopes, including air temperature, relative humidity and snow depth from 11 sites in the watershed. Hourly measurements of solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and soil moisture and temperature are available at selected stations. The dataset includes hourly stream discharge measured at the watershed outlet. These data provide the scientific community with a unique dataset useful for forcing and validating models in interdisciplinary studies and will allow for better representation and understanding of the complex processes that occur in the rain-to-snow transition zone.

Snow accumulation data from Wyoming snow gauges near the ANWR coastal plain were summarized for the period l97n-1986. Total snow accumulation was low in 1984 and closer to average in 198'1 and 1986. Monthly snow measurements were made on 2 transects on Barter Island in 1985 and 1986. Snow depths gradually increased during both winters, while deeth hoar increased early in the season and remained the same from January through May. Hardness of snow or the strength of bonding between crystals was measured using a Rammsonde penetrometer. The Rammsonde hardness increased during the first part of both winters, then decreased after March or April. Hardness was highly variable at individual points along the transects. Snow density averaged 0.30 g/cm3 over both years. Snow depths were measured as seismic crews traveled across the coastal plain in 1984 and 1985. These snow depths averaged 23 em in 1984 and 30 em in 1985. Snow distribution across the coastal plain was highly variable due to wind transport of snow which resulted in little cover on hill crests or ridges and deep accumulations in basins and drainages. The area west of the Sadlerochit River had less snow than the eastern portion of the coastal plain. On the western side, moist sedge tussock tundra and moist graminoid/barren tundra complex had less snow than wet graminoid tundra. Overall, wet graminoid tundra and closed riparian shrubland had the highest snow depths, while Dryas terrace and open riparian shrubland had the lowest snow depths. No significant differences in average snow depths were observed between terrain types, elevations, and aspects. Ninety study plots were established on seismic lines and camp moves in tussock tundra and moist sedge-shrub tundra to study the relationship between snow cover and disturbance. Snow depth data were collected in the winter, and plant cover changes, tussock disturbance, and trail visibility were measured in the summer. Plots with greater snow depths were generally less disturbed. In tussock tundra, plots with snow depths over 25 cm had significantly less disturbance than those with less than 25 cm. Snow depths over 25 em or slab depths over 15 em prevented moderate disturbance. The relationship between snow cover and disturbance was less clear in moist sedge-shrub tundra, and in a number of cases, slab depth appeared to be a better measure of protective snow cover than total snow depth which included the underlying depth hoar. Snow depths over 35 em or slab depths over 20 em prevented moderate disturbance in moist sedge-shrub tundra. Many other factors were important in determining the amount of disturbance, especially at lower snow depths."

                "text": "Normal behavior of snow geese on the Yukon-Alaska north slope and the effects of aircraft-induced disturbance on this behavior During September, large numbers of snow geese (up to 400,000) congregate on the North Slope of Yukon and Alaska where they accumulate energy reserves to fuel their fall migration. These geese are potentially susceptible to disturbance by aircraft overflights. This study was designed to document normal (i.e. undisturbed) behavior of snow geese during staging, and evaluate the effects of overflights by various types of aircraft upon this behavior. The ability of snow geese to accommodate to increased disturbance was assessed. In September 1973, observations of snow geese were made at five camps along the North Slope. The behavior of undisturbed geese was documented during 663 hours of observations on over 175 flocks. The behavior of geese during 73 natural disturbances and 163 non-experimental aircraft overflights was observed. Experimental overflights at two hour and half hour intervals using a small fixed wing aircraft (Cessna 185) and a small helicopter (Bell 206-B) were used to assess the reactions of snow geese to controlled disturbances. These experiments also provided data on the ability of snow geese to accommodate to an increased frequency of disturbance. Undisturbed snow geese spent 57% of daylight hours feeding. For the juveniles alone this figure was 65-70%. Flocks of snow geese were equally prone to flush in response to fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. They flushed at greater distances from helicopters, but flew for a longer time and exhibited longer overall interruption of normal behavior in response to fixed-wing aircraft. Snow geese accommodated to a varying extent to increased frequencies of overflights by small fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Non-experimental aircraft disturbances averaged 0.25 per daylight hour. These resulted in a potential decrease of 2.6% in time spent feeding. Experimental overflights at two hour intervals by fixed-wing aircraft produced more severe reactions. These caused an 8.5% decrease in feeding time, and could cause a reduction of 20.4% in the energy reserves that juvenile geese can acquire on the North Slope in preparation for migration. The corresponding figure for overflights by small helicopter is a possible reduction of 9.5%. These potential decreases are dependent upon the extent of  and the ability to increase overall feeding efforts."

In early May 2005, an estimated 3.8  106 m3 of sulfurous, clay-rich debris and acidic water, with an accompanying acidic aerosol component, exited the crater through a tunnel at the base of a glacier that breaches the south crater rim. Over 27 km downstream, the acidic waters of the flood inundated an important salmon spawning drainage, acidifying Mother Goose Lake from surface to depth (approximately 0.5 km3 in volume at a pH of 2.9 to 3.1), killing all aquatic life, and preventing the annual salmon run. Over 2 months later, crater lakter sampled 8 km downstream of the outlet after considerable dilmeltwater was a weak sulfuric acid solution (pH = 3.2, SO4 = 504 = 7.92 mg/L). The acid flood waters caused severe vegetation daand leaf kill along the flood path. The crater lake drainage was accompanied by an ambioructic flow of acidic aerosols that follrotic leaf damage to vegetation in a 29 km2 area along and above affected streams, in areas to heights of over 150 m above streaating extremely elevated atmospheric sulfur content. The most abundant airborne phytotoxic constituent was likely sulfuric acid ter lake drainage event. Two mechanisms of acidic aerosol formation are proposed: (1) generation of aerosol mist through turbuleenon of simultaneous vegetation damaging acidic aerosols accompanying drainage of an acidic crater lake has important implicatioAe waution from glacial  mg/L, Cl = 53.6 mg/L, and Fmage, including plant death owed the flood path, contributing to defoliation and necm level. Moss species killed in the event contained high levels of sulfur, indicaerosols that were generated during the catastrophic partial crant flow of acidic water and (2) catastrophic gas exsolution. This previously undocumented phenomns for the study of hazards associated with active volcanic crater lakes."

We evaluated the importance of this grit site to light geese in southwest Louisiana from 1 November 2001 to 10 February 2004. Specifically, we estimated:(1) distances flown to the grit site by snow geese from other parts of southwest Louisiana; (2) return probabilities to the grit site of snow geese neck-banded at CPNWR; (3) whether male and female snow geese used the grit site similarly; and (4) the ratio of Ross's geese to snow geese at the grit site, compared to elsewhere in our study area, by using a likelihood-ratio test.   We neck-banded 414 snow geese at CPNWR in winters 2001-2002,2002-2003, and 2003-2004. Snow geese banded at CPNWR regularly used rice-fields near Sweet Lake(10-15 km north of CPNWR) and Thornwell(30-60 km of CPNWR); a few individuals were observed further west or east and southeast of CPNWR. Return probabilities to the grit site from Sweet Lake were 0.39 and 0.19 for male and female snow geese, respectively; return probabilities from Thornwell were 0.14 and 0.08 for males and females, respectively. Ross's geese used CPNWR in proportion to their abundance elsewhere in study area. Our results indicate that: (1) the grit site at CPNWR is used by snow geese from all over southwest Louisiana; (2) snow geese frequently fly distances up to 60 miles to use the grit site; (3) Ross's geese are equally likely to use the grit site as are snow geese."

Two dams on the Elwha River, Washington State, USA trapped over 20 million m3 of sediment, reducing downstream sediment fluxes and contributing to erosion of the river's coastal delta. The removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams between 2011 and 2014 induced massive increases in river sediment supply and provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine the response of a delta system to changes in sediment supply. The U.S. Geological Survey developed an integrated research program aimed at understanding the ecosystem responses following dam removal that included regular monitoring of coastal and nearshore bathymetry and topography. As part of this monitoring program, the USGS conducted a bathymetric and topographic survey in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the Elwha River delta, Washington (USGS Field Activity Number 2014-620-FA). Bathymetry data were collected using two personal watercraft (PWCs), each equipped with single-beam echosounders and survey-grade global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. Topography data were collected on foot with GNSS receivers mounted on backpacks. DEM surfaces were produced from all available elevation data using linear interpolation."

Introduction    The Human Capital Project is one of three projects under the second compact, and it focuses on improving the quality of education and achieving a better match between the supply of skills and the demands of the labor market as they pertain to the international trade of goods and services in El Salvador. The Human Capital Project consists of two activities: (1) the Education Quality Activity, which is intended to improve the quality of the national education system; and (2) the Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) System Reform Activity. The TVET System Reform Activity, with funding of nearly $15 million, is intended to enhance its capacity to harmonize the skills supplied through education and training providers with the skills demanded by the labor market.     MCC contracted with Mathematica to conduct an evaluation of the activities under the Human Capital Project, including the TVET System Reform Activity. Mathematica will conduct a performance evaluation of the TVET System Reform Activity to document its implementation and assess how successful the project was at achieving the intended outcomes. Lessons learned through this performance evaluation will be useful for stakeholders as they continue improving the TVET system, and to inform decisions about the potential expansion of the reform activities to other sectors beyond the sectors focalized by FOMILENIO II.  II. Overview of the Technical  Education and Professional Training System  (TEPT) Activity The revised implementation of this Activity encompasses two main sub activities:     1. Integrated Technical Education and Professional Training Systems Sub-Activity: The revised implementation plan for this sub-activity includes two strategies:         a. Capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. The capacity building strategy has two goals: the first is to enable the private and public sector to identify and manage demands for technical education and professional training. The second is to enable public sector stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of education and training programs to respond quickly and efficiently to private sector labor market demands.     b. Strengthen the link between the supply and demand of technical education and professional training  through the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of information within and between productive sectors , and between private and public institutions in all productive sectors. FOMILENIO II will support the development of sectoral diagnostics to identify the needs of the productive sector, and improve the match between the industries and the training offerings in specified geographic areas. The following are the main tasks for implementing this strategy: 1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; 2) design or update three optional modules of the BTVs with input from the Sectoral Committees; and 3) Establish agreements between companies from the productive sectors and MINED to offer internships for students.    2. Continuous Labor Demand Assessment Sub-Activity. Two strategies encompass the implementation of this sub-activity: 1) establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework; and 2) strengthen the labor market observatory, integrating existing efforts to track labor market conditions.  III. Logic Model    The TEPT Activity in El Salvador is designed to link activities in the systems of technical education and professional training to the needs of the labor market in order to close the gap between training and employment. To that end, TEPT activities are largely focused on facilitating the exchange of information between the supply side and the demand side, both within and between productive sectors. The theory of change behind the implementation of the TEPT Activity states that all of its outputs will increase companies' productivity, and thereby improve workers' wages as well as the employability and socioeconomic standing of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.    1. Activities    The TEPT Activity funded by FOMILENIO II aims to strengthen capacity building at the individual, organizational, and public policy level. To that end, this strategy includes (1) creating sectoral committees for technical and educational training, and creating a Sectoral Committee Board to consolidate the demand for professional development in the private sector; (2) offering professional training to workers in the different industrial sectors under the competency-based approach; (3) designing models for certifying workers by competencies and accrediting institutions; (4) creating a Coordination Council of Technical Education and Professional Training to facilitate coordination between public and private organizations involved in technical and professional training, and align the offerings to the skills demanded in the labor market; and (5) establishing procedures and regulations to strengthen the institutional capacity to meet the private sector's demand for technical education and professional training. Implementation of the TEPT Activity includes the design of a roadmap for creating a national qualifications framework, and the development of an information system for the Coordination Council and other bodies to use in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the TEPT Activity.    The TEPT activity also seeks to improve the link between labor demand in the productive sectors with the availability of technical education and vocational training. To achieve this goal, FOMILENIO II plans to: (1) identify the prioritized productive sectors in each department and the availability of related technical and professional programs in those geographic areas; (2) design at least three modules for the Vocational Technical Baccalaureate in coordination with the Sectoral Committees; and (3) establish agreements between companies from the sectors and MINEDUCYT to offer internships for students.     2. Short- and medium-term outcomes    Once the sectoral committees and the Board of Sectoral Committees are in existence, and a model for certification and accreditation has been implemented, the private sector will improve its capacity to identify and influence the professional training that is available to prospective trainees. Designing modules for the Professional Technical Baccalaureate, and creating the Coordination Council of TEPT will also improve the linkage between the demands of the productive sector, and the availability of technical education and vocational training.     3. Long-term outcomes    In the long term, the TEPT Activity is expected to improve the government's capacity to plan and evaluate the offer of technical education and professional training assisted by the MNC and the information system developed for subsequent planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the improved match between labor demand in the industrial/private sectors and the technical training available to the potential workforce will improve the productivity of companies, and therefore increase workers' wages. It is also expected to improve the employability of students and workers who benefit from the TEPT Activity.  IV. Evaluation design    The aims of the performance evaluation are to (1) assess progress toward the short- and medium-term outcomes that the program was designed to achieve and (2) understand and document the implementation of the Technical Education and Professional Training activities. To meet these two overarching aims, the performance evaluation will include a pre-post analysis of program outcomes and an implementation study.    A. Pre-post design.    The single group pre-post design consists of obtaining data for the outcomes of interest prior to (or at the beginning of) TEPT training (pre) and the same measure after participation in the TEPT courses (post). The pre-post study will focus on measuring the changes on labor market outcomes, and assessing to what extent work conditions, wages, and employment status improved for those who participated in the TEPT programs.     B. Implementation study     The implementation study will focus on describing all components of the TEPT program and their operation and identifying progress towards short- and medium-term outcomes of the program. We will document how program components were implemented, explore the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation of TEPT sub-activities, and describe the main program outputs of the TEPT System. We will also identify short- and long-term achievements and sustainability efforts related to each TEPT sub-activity.  V. Evaluation research questions    The pre-post study will focus on three descriptive research questions:    1. Did employee work conditions, benefits or non-wage compensation, change for trainees who participated in the TEPT courses approximately six to nine months after the courses ended?     2. Did wages change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    3. Did employment status change for trainees who participated TEPT courses (as measured about six to nine months after the courses ended)?    We will examine five main overarching research questions through the implementation study:    1. How were the TEPT sub-activities implemented, and what were the major facilitators and barriers to implementation?    2. Were some sectors more successful implementing the TEPT activities than others?    3. Which outputs were accomplished for each sub-activity, and to what extent did they meet the targets?     4. Which short- and long-term outcomes were accomplished for each sub-activity?     5. What are the plans for the institutional and financial sustainability of the services offered and the entities created as part of the TEPT activity?  VI. Data sources and analysis plan    A. Pre-post study:     Data sources.     The primary data source for the performance evaluation will be the trainee tracer survey. In collaboration with FOMILENIO II, we will field the pre-training tracer survey (baseline) with about 500 participants who are enrolled in TEPT courses, either prior to or within one month of their course initiation. TEPT courses will be rolled out starting the second quarter of 2019. Because the timing for the rollout will vary, baseline data collection will take place on a rolling basis and will be aligned with the course rollout plan for the prioritized sectors. We plan to conduct the baseline survey as a Computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ) with groups of enrolled trainees at their training sites and the follow-up survey as an individual, face-to-face, computer-administered questionnaire at respondents' work sites or homes. We will collect the follow-up survey six to nine months after the course ends by following a staggered timeline similar to the baseline data collection. The follow-up survey is expected to start in mid-2020 and to extend beyond the compact period.     Analyses.     To assess changes in work conditions, wages, and employment status sometime after participants should have completed the TEPT training programs, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the tracer survey data for trainees in FOMILENIO II-supported courses. We will compare key outcome indicators at baseline and follow-up for each trainee-level outcome and report averages (mean percent change) for the full sample of trainees and also by gender. We will also describe the background trainee characteristics, such as gender, age, and education level. The analysis will include a cross-sector comparison of participant characteristics and implementation milestones.    B. Implementation study    Data sources.     We will draw on three sources to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on outputs and achievements of the TEPT activity: (1) stakeholder interviews, (2) program monitoring data, and (3) a document review.     Analyses.     a. Analytic approach for quantitative program implementation data. We will conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on monitoring data to summarize the program outputs and understand short-term and long-term program achievements.    b. Analytic approach for qualitative program implementation data. We will prepare interview and focus group transcripts and conduct thematic analysis in two sequential steps. The first step involves conducting data reduction and mapping transcript segments to the core performance research questions. The second step involves thematic framing-the process of distilling themes and identifying patterns in qualitative data. We will develop a coding framework with a hierarchy of conceptual categories that are linked to the research questions and the program logic model. We will also create thematic memos for data synthesis and interpretation of key findings.     To take advantage of the complementarity that a mixed-methods approach affords, we will integrate findings from descriptive quantitative analysis of monitoring and administrative data with findings from qualitative data sources. We will summarize program outputs and outcomes from FOMILENIO II's administrative records and implementation reports by using data abstraction templates that we will design for this study. We will also create summary tables of qualitative findings from key stakeholder interviews. Then, we will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings by using triangulation techniques to (1) assess the consistency of the findings across methods and data sources, (2) confirm patterns of findings, and (3) identify potential discrepancies across data sources. Furthermore, information from the qualitative data collection related to barriers and facilitators to program implementation will help us interpret the findings from the quantitative analysis."

The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water. It has long been used for science and education as well as for higher education purposes, providing sites for field trips, study areas for student research, and serving as a source of instructional examples. Recreation is another obvious appeal of wilderness, and wilderness areas are seeing steadily increasing use from people who wish to experience freedom from the Nation\u2019s fast-paced industrialized society."

In this paper I examine foraging behavior of Piping Plover to determine factors that affect the time plovers devote to foraging. Objectives of the study were to determine: (1) where Piping Plovers foraged, (2) time devoted to foraging as a function of nesting beach, reproductive stage and brood size, and (3) the effect of human activities on foraging time. Piping Plovers are ideal for such an examination because they nest solitarily on barrier beach islands that have suffered from increased human development and recreational activities. I examined foraging behavior because clutch size) and nest sites do not seem to be causing population declines. Thus I wanted to determine whether Piping Plover experienced difficulties foraging because of people. Reproductive success is lower in areas with high human disturbance. Foraging behavior of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) was studied using a focal animal approach from 1985-1986. Time devoted to foraging decreased as vigilance (time devoted to being alert) increased. Variations in vigilance were explained by beach, reproductive stage, brood size, time of day, and number of people nearby. Overall, Piping Plovers foraged from 46-79 sec., were alert for 14-57 sec., and displayed or ran from people for 1-8 sec. in the 2 min. samples. Plovers at sites less disturbed by people (Little Beach, Holgate) generally devoted more time to foraging and less time to vigilance than birds at the other sites. Time devoted to foraging was generally higher In May, lower in June, and increased again in July. Plovers that were incubating or caring for chicks spent less time foraging than those that had lost their chicks. Chicks spent less time foraging and more time being alert, running, and crouching than did their parents foraging during the same time periods. With increasing brood size, chicks spent less time foraging and more time running or crouching although the number of people nearby did not vary. Behavior was correlated within members of a pair: birds spent less time foraging as their mates increased time devoted to alertness, being off the nest, or displaying. When brooding birds increased alert time, their mates increased their alertness and displaying, and decreased foraging time. As the number of people near foraging plovers increased, time devoted to running and crouching increased and time devoted to feeding decreased. It appears that the presence of people is stressful for breeding adults and chicks, forcing them to spend significantly less time foraging, perhaps accounting for decreased overall reproductive success."

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

To this end, scientists from the Carolinas Integrated Sciences and Assessments (CISA), United States Geological Survey (USGS) South Carolina Water Science Center, and Advanced Data Mining International (ADMi) investigated the threat of saltwater intrusion in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River (YPDR) basin under conditions influenced by ongoing and future climatic change, with an emphasis on changes in the frequency and duration of saltwater intrusion events with increasing sea levels. In addition, project leaders enhanced a decision support system (DSS) that is relevant and user-friendly to incorporate planning for future coastal climate change. Of central focus in this study was the ever-present need to address how humans will respond to ongoing and future changes in our environment, particularly under climatic regimes that may not have been felt by present society.The primary components of the project included empirical and mechanistic modeling of hydrologic conditions in the YPDR system to determine freshwater discharge and resulting salinity intrusion at the coast under future climatic conditions and sea level rise and updating an existing DSS to address saltwater intrusion challenges for resource managers, industry, and water and sewer districts in the study basin. The project team used the Environmental Protectin Agency (EPA) BASINS HSPF model and the \u201cPee Dee River and Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Salinity Model\u201d (PRISM) (Conrads and Roehl 2007) to conduct the empirical and modeling analysis. The updated PRISM2 DSS allows users to adjust sea level rise and flow levels in the YPDR basin to generate scenarios of how future climate change (e.g., the potential for more frequent drought conditions) and sea level rise may impact the inland penetration and duration of saltwater intrusion events.The S.C. Sea Grant Consortium, CISA, and the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) held a stakeholder workshop on December 14, 2011, in Georgetown, SC, to discuss saltwater intrusion planning challenges and information needs with regional decision makers and to obtain their input regarding the utility of the PRISM2 DSS. Participants were introduced to three alternative flow scenarios that simulated potential impacts from climate change and its resulting effects on the frequency and longevity of saltwater intrusion events in relation to decreased streamflow and rising sea levels. Workshop participants highlighted several major ecological and water supply infrastructure concerns that would have to be addressed under the provided scenarios. They also contributed salient feedback regarding additional needs for information, planning tools, and procedures. Relevant to the interests of regional stakeholders, the PRISM2 DSS demonstrated the effects of salinity intrusion events on the frequency and duration of higher conductance values in water sources. Such events are problematic for the operations of municipal water treatment plants when the specific conductance values for source water are greater than 1,000 to 2,000 \u03bcS/cm. Participants suggested that with the addition of further pertinent information (e.g., 4 ecological/species salinity thresholds), the PRISM2 DSS can help decision-makers plan for future severe events (e.g., positioning freshwater intakes and treatment facilities, preparing for increased treatment costs) while increasing the region\u2019s resilience by encouraging preparation for potential changes in the frequency and magnitude of saltwater intrusion events."

                "text": "El Salvador - Formal Technical Education With a budget of nearly $20 million, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was designed to strengthen technical and vocational educational institutions in the Northern Zone of El Salvador. By improving schools and offering scholarships, the sub-activity financed efforts to increase youths' access to high-quality technical education in the region, thus increasing their achievement levels, secondary (and post-secondary) school graduation rates, and prospects for gainful employment. By 2012, the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity was scheduled to invest $3.8 million in scholarships for students enrolled in secondary and post-secondary technical schools in the Northern Zone. According to preliminary budgets, the sub-activity would also provide $9 million to improve 20 technical secondary schools in the Northern Zone with infrastructure investments and additional teacher training programs. In addition, the sub-activity was scheduled to invest $7 million to strengthen ITCHA, an existing post-secondary institute in the Northern Zone.   In conducting the evaluation of the Formal Technical Education Sub-Activity-which includes secondary and post-secondary school improvements and scholarships-Mathematica will address the following research questions regarding Sub-Activity investments from 2009 to 2012:   1.Program design/implementation. How were the secondary school strengthening and scholarship programs, and the ITCHA strengthening program designed and implemented? Did implementation meet original targets and expectations? Why or why not?  2.Description of participants. What are the characteristics (age, gender, initial household income, etc.) of scholarship recipients? What are the basic characteristics of secondary school and ITCHA students?   3.Impact/Results. What is the impact of FOMILENIO's strengthening secondary school program on students' education and labor market outcomes, including secondary school enrollment, grade completion, graduation, and further education, employment, and income? What is the impact of the offer of scholarships in some programs within strengthened schools on student educational and labor outcomes? Did ITCHA graduates obtain jobs and experience increased income following graduation? Did ITCHA students who graduated from secondary school MEGATEC programs have better academic and labor market outcomes than students who did not attend secondary school MEGATEC programs?  4.Impacts/Results by key target subgroups. Were impacts/results different for girls versus boys? What types of participants experienced positive impacts?  5.Explanation for impact findings and results. What was the ex-post statistical power, and can this explain the lack of impacts (in cases where no impacts are found)? What aspects of implementation could explain the impacts/results? If impacts/results were different for girls versus boys, why?  6.Sustainability. Are secondary school improvements and scholarships being maintained? Are ITCHA improvements being maintained? Are they likely to be maintained in the medium to long term?   To answer all research questions regarding the design, implementation, and sustainability of the strengthening efforts and scholarships (Topics 1, 2, 5, and 6), Matheatica will use a mixed-methods evaluation design that uses qualitative and quantitative methods (see Table III.1). With this approach, researchers will use qualitative methods-namely, qualitative interview data and programmatic reports-to help understand processes and activities, provide information on setting or context, and communicate the perspectives and experiences of key participants through direct quotes. In addition, Mathematica will use quantitative information on program outputs and costs, participant characteristics, and budget outlays to summarize the intervention, describe its participants, and analyze the sustainability of its original investments.   To answer research questions regarding impacts and results (3, 4, and 5), Mathematica will use a variety of designs. To determine the impact of secondary school scholarships, researchers designed and implemented a random assignment design, by which some eligible applicants were randomly selected to receive scholarships. To determine the impact of secondary school strengthening investments, Mathematica designed and implemented a matched comparison group approach using propensity score methods, by which students at the 20 strengthened schools are compared to students at 20 similar non-strengthened schools. Finally, to measure key results of the ITCHA intervention-including graduation and employment rates-researchers used a mixed-methods approach that featured a follow-up survey of ITCHA students.   All impact and results analyses rely on in-person surveys, including panel surveys of scholarship applicants, cross-sectional baseline and follow-up surveys of secondary school students, and a follow-up survey of ITCHA students."

ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS: Which drugs are the most relevant for each type of ag production system?  At what level do excreted drugs continue to provide selective pressure in the environment?    RESISTANT BACTERIA: What is the relative contribution of specific bacteria to resistance in human clinical settings?  Are some bacteria more likely than others to donate or receive resistance genes?  What is the relative contribution of clonal spread of pathogens versus horizontal gene transfer?    RESISTANT GENES: How long do specific types of genes persist in agricultural samples?  What conditions increase or decrease the likelihood of a successful transfer in manure, soil, water, and air?  What is the role of the natural soil \"resistome\"?    AgAR Network Goals:  Connect ARS researchers at multiple locations in order to develop and assess methods for measuring resistance that are robust, and that are validated across production systems and geographical areas.    Identify which types of resistance are relevant to measure, based on an understanding of individual production systems and prioritized human health threats as identified by WHO and CDC    Encourage the collection of baseline data and control samples so that the impact of agricultural best management practices can be accurately determined.    Assess persistence of antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in environmental and pre-harvest settings.    Long term goal: Discover the details of how, and at what rate bacteria and genes move back and forth between animals and humans through agricultural systems (soil, water, air wildlife, insects, and food).  The AgAR network is composed of ARS scientists with an interest in understanding the ecology of antibiotic resistance in soil, water, air, insects, wildlife, and food. The network currently represents 4 national programs at 10 ARS locations across the United States, with over 200 peer-reviewed publications on AgAR topics, authored and co-authored by over 70 current and former ARS employees.    Activities:  Facilitate routine communication between AgAR members to address priority research areas, encourage agency and location wide collaboration and minimize research overlap.    Establish a framework for the cross-laboratory validation of AgAR methods.    Serve as a resource to scientists, stakeholders and administrators on current and past projects that address AgAR.    Provide a point of contact for agency coordinators to solicit information and transmit agency goals to relevant research groups.  Importance:    While there is broad agreement the use of antibiotics in food animals has the potential to adversely impact human clinical outcomes, the details of how this happens are unknown, and there is a critical need for information on antibiotic resistance (AR) in agricultural settings (AgAR).  U.S. and international health organizations have taken the lead on identifying specific antibiotic drugs and resistant infections that are critical to human health. ARS is uniquely positioned to provide information on the \"farm\" side of the \"farm to fork continuum\". ARS scientists are able to address these questions in a practical way, by combining their experience (over 200 peer-reviewed ARS publications on antibiotic resistance) with their applied understanding of agricultural production systems.    ORGANIZATION: Scientists work on their own, individual research projects. The AgAR network provides resources to participants to encourage collaboration across program areas and geographical location.    MANAGEMENT: The AgAR network is operated using a wiki community approach. All participating scientists are encouraged to contribute to and share in the community resources.   Currently, the group resources will be curated by the group coordinator, with input and guidance from a five person advisory panel.

Calculated water content values equal to less than zero are changed to zero in converted water content data set. Converted water content values are a volume/volume relationship and represent cm3 water/cm3 soil. Data from neutron probe data logger is dumped to disk. Raw count data is then converted to water content using a Fortran program called WC2.FOR (water content for LTER-II). Water content data is then sorted by i.d. number using a LOTUS 123 macro found in WC2_SORT.WQ1 which creates final version of water content data set for the month in a separate file. Two files per month are saved: raw count data (mmddyy-2.RAW; ex. 121189-2.RAW where -2 indicates LTER-II NPP site neutron probe readings) and calculated/ sorted soil water content data appended to data file containing that year's data (NPPSWCyy.DAT; example NPPSWC89.DAT contains NPP soil water content data for 1989).

Because trace element concentrations, mixed function oxidase activity, and the variation in DNA are often associated with petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in birds, each was measured as indicators of petroleum contamination. Sediment and aquatic invertebrates were also sampled for characterizing a possible contaminant source to the birds. Sampling areas included sites upstream (Game & Fish, Patterson-Zonta Park), adjacent to (Amoco Park, Texaco Refinery), and downstream (EKW State Park) of the former Amoco and Texaco oil refineries. We also sampled one site between the Amoco and Texaco Refineries (Crossroads Park). Additional samples were taken using adult cliff swallows (Hirundo pyrrhonota) nesting under various bridges along the North Platte River in 1998. Several aliphatic hydrocarbons were detected in sediment, aquatic invertebrates, and carcasses and gastrointestinal contents of house wren and tree swallow nestlings and adult bam and cliff swallows from all sites but differences among sites were not significant. The low pristane to n-C17 ratio in avian diet and tissues did not suggest chronic or acute exposure of birds to petroleum at any of the locations. However, the high phytane to n-C18 ratios of the gastrointestinal contents may indicate that some of the dietary items consumed by the birds were recently or chronically exposed to petroleum products. This study demonstrates that some refinery-related contaminants are bioavailable and birds are being exposed. However, the data do not exhibit any pattern that can be linked to the refineries. Our small sample size and limited statistical power do not allow us to determine if any of the contaminants are adversely affecting the birds; and, the data collected on adult birds are inconclusive because exposure to contaminants may have occurred outside the sampling area. Additionally, for several contaminants detected, the upstream Game &Fish site appears to have concentrations similar to the study sites. Finally, we were unable to determine the influence of yearly variation on the results of the petroleum hydrocarbon or trace element analyses from 1997 and 1998; but, the 1997 data from the EKW State Park were not critical to the overall conclusions of the manuscript."

Lastly, if wetlands do posses high emergent cover : low open water interspersion, what dominant species of emergent vegetation are present and will they likely persist during widely fluctuating hydroperiods as typified in Prairie Pothole wetlands. Previous research has indicated that wetlands with an approximate 50:50 ratio of open water and emergent vegetation such as cattails and bulrushes, often termed hemi\u2010marshes, attract the highest densities of wetland birds (Weller and Spatcher 1965). Others have indicated that within \"managed\" wetlands, an open water:emergent vegetation ratio of 70:30 should be a management goal. \"Undeveloped\" wetlands represent a majority of wetlands present within the DLWMD and other North Dakota and South Dakota Wetland Management Districts, and these wetlands lack wetland management capabilities (USFWS 2008).The CCP for North Dakota Wetland Management Districts has identified \"undeveloped\" wetland habitat as wetlands with no water level management (USFWS 2008). With this lack of management capability wetlands have responded to a variety of environmental stressors including invasive species encroachment. Many mangers, researchers and biologists (Raymond Finnochario, Ecologist, NPWRC, Terry Shaffer, Statistician, NPWRC, Neil Niemuth, Research Biologist, HAPET, Tom Kohener, Refuge Manager, Sand Lake WMD, Mike Goos, Refuge Manager, Devils Lake WMD, Roger Hollevoet, Project Leader, Devils Lake WMD, Harold A. Kantrud, Wetland Ecologist, NPWRC\u2010Retired, pers. comms.) have identified an overabundance of emergent vegetation from non\u2010native cattail (Typha angustifolia, T. x. glauca) as a reason for concern, particularly for avian resources dependent upon a diverse assemblage of hydrophytes and aquatic freshwater invertebrates. An acceleration of emergent cattail growth coupled with land use changes (circa. late 1960\u2019s) within wetland habitats of the Drift Prairie ecoregion have become severe (Harold F. Duebbert, Harold A. Kantrud pers. comms). Invasive species dominance result in decreased hydrophyte diversity, and will directly result in decreased invertebrate productivity and decreased species richness (Murkin et al. 1991, Weinhold et al. 1989). Aquatic invertebrates are important dietary items of waterfowl (Krapu et al. 1992, 1974a, 1974b, Knutsen and Euliss 2001) and other wetland\u2010dependent birds (Reeder 1951; Fritzell et al. 1979). Wetland ecologists warn that an increase of monotypic stands of cattails decreases biological diversity within wetland ecosystems and without long term invasive species controls, hybrid cattail will likely reestablish and replace native communities (Boers et al. 2007). In addition, pending climate change has been predicted to negatively affect prairie wetlands, and habitat quality will continue to decline from a nearly balanced emergent cover : open water ratio to a completely closed basin with little or no open water (Poiani and Johnson 1991, Johnson et al 2005)."

This dataset contains reservoir data from stations in SGP97 domain. The data collected at USGS gaging stations consist of records of stage and measurements of discharge of streams or canals, and stage, surface area, and contents of lakes or reservoirs. This dataset contains only the USGS reservoir data. For a lake or reservoir, capacity tables giving the contents for any stage are prepared from stage-area relation curves defined by surveys. The application of the stage to the capacity table gives the contents, from which the daily, monthly, or yearly change in contents is computed. If the stage-capacity curve is subject to changes because of deposition of sediment in the reservoir, periodic resurveys of the reservoir are necessary to define new stage-capacity curves.  During the period between reservoir surveys, the computed contents may be increasingly in error due to the gradual accumulation of sediments. For some gaging stations there are periods when no gage-height record is obtained or the recorded gage height is so faulty that it cannot be used to compute daily discharge or contents. This happens when the recorder stops or otherwise fails to operate properly, intakes are plugged, the float is frozen in the well, or for various other reasons. For such periods, the daily contents may be estimated on the basis of operator's log, prior and subsequent records, inflow-outflow studies, and other information. The USGS reservoir data are provided in a single file and are provided \"as is\" in their original card image format. There are six different types of \"cards images\" which appear in the USGS reservoir dataset. Each card has a unique format, but the first character of a card image always indicates the card type. Depending upon the card type, the card image may contain metadata and/or data. No additional quality control was performed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS)."

Introduced mountain goats (Oreamnus americanus) on Kodiak Island havefollowed an irruptive population growth pattern, typified by low density ungulatesthat are free of predation pressure and have abundant forage resources. Inresponse to concerns over potential impacts to native flora and fauna from a highdensity mountain goat population and to improve harvest management, we soughtto quantify mountain goat summer diets, feeding site selection, and availableforage resources across three subpopulations at different densities and durationsof site occupancy. Between June and August, we collected fecal pellets from goatgroups that were primarily composed of nannies, and to a lesser extent kids andbillies. Microhistological analyses of the pellets revealed that diets (uncorrectedfor differential digestibility of forage components) were largely composed of fernrhizomes and grasses in early summer (June), and sedges and forbs later in thesummer (July to mid-August). The proportion of forage in goat diets variedacross subpopulation, but dietary differences among subpopulations wereuncorrelated with subpopulation density or duration of occupancy. Mountaingoats selectively used sites with abundant sedge, rush, and moss on south-facingslopes close ( x = 57 m) to escape terrain (slopes >33o). Forage quality, measuredas digestible protein and dry matter digestibility, of primary goat forage classesthat composed more than 5% of their diets, varied among forage classes,according to sequential fiber analyses. Digestible protein content declined by anaverage of 5% between early and late summer across all study sites. In contrast,dry matter digestibility did not vary over the summer or between study sites.Forage biomass varied by aspect, day of the year, slope, and study site We foundno evidence that forage biomass differed between feeding and random sites,suggesting that goats did not select feeding sites based on forage biomass. Thisstudy was the first to quantify mountain goat diets, feeding site selection, andforage resources on Kodiak Island. These findings will guide management of theKodiak mountain goat population and likely apply more generally to mountaingoat populations in coastal Alaska."

ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS: Which drugs are the most relevant for each type of ag production system?  At what level do excreted drugs continue to provide selective pressure in the environment?    RESISTANT BACTERIA: What is the relative contribution of specific bacteria to resistance in human clinical settings?  Are some bacteria more likely than others to donate or receive resistance genes?  What is the relative contribution of clonal spread of pathogens versus horizontal gene transfer?    RESISTANT GENES: How long do specific types of genes persist in agricultural samples?  What conditions increase or decrease the likelihood of a successful transfer in manure, soil, water, and air?  What is the role of the natural soil \"resistome\"?    AgAR Network Goals:  Connect ARS researchers at multiple locations in order to develop and assess methods for measuring resistance that are robust, and that are validated across production systems and geographical areas.    Identify which types of resistance are relevant to measure, based on an understanding of individual production systems and prioritized human health threats as identified by WHO and CDC    Encourage the collection of baseline data and control samples so that the impact of agricultural best management practices can be accurately determined.    Assess persistence of antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in environmental and pre-harvest settings.    Long term goal: Discover the details of how, and at what rate bacteria and genes move back and forth between animals and humans through agricultural systems (soil, water, air wildlife, insects, and food).  The AgAR network is composed of ARS scientists with an interest in understanding the ecology of antibiotic resistance in soil, water, air, insects, wildlife, and food. The network currently represents 4 national programs at 10 ARS locations across the United States, with over 200 peer-reviewed publications on AgAR topics, authored and co-authored by over 70 current and former ARS employees.    Activities:  Facilitate routine communication between AgAR members to address priority research areas, encourage agency and location wide collaboration and minimize research overlap.    Establish a framework for the cross-laboratory validation of AgAR methods.    Serve as a resource to scientists, stakeholders and administrators on current and past projects that address AgAR.    Provide a point of contact for agency coordinators to solicit information and transmit agency goals to relevant research groups.  Importance:    While there is broad agreement the use of antibiotics in food animals has the potential to adversely impact human clinical outcomes, the details of how this happens are unknown, and there is a critical need for information on antibiotic resistance (AR) in agricultural settings (AgAR).  U.S. and international health organizations have taken the lead on identifying specific antibiotic drugs and resistant infections that are critical to human health. ARS is uniquely positioned to provide information on the \"farm\" side of the \"farm to fork continuum\". ARS scientists are able to address these questions in a practical way, by combining their experience (over 200 peer-reviewed ARS publications on antibiotic resistance) with their applied understanding of agricultural production systems.    ORGANIZATION: Scientists work on their own, individual research projects. The AgAR network provides resources to participants to encourage collaboration across program areas and geographical location.    MANAGEMENT: The AgAR network is operated using a wiki community approach. All participating scientists are encouraged to contribute to and share in the community resources.   Currently, the group resources will be curated by the group coordinator, with input and guidance from a five person advisory panel.

                "text": "Data from: Defensive aphid symbiont Hamiltonella defensa effects on Aphelinus glycinis and Aphelinus atriplicis Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa /APSE by two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.    Insect sources and rearing conditions    Aphelinus glycinis was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Aphelinus atriplicis was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect Aphis craccivora or Acyrthosiphon pisum because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.    Aphis craccivora is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Acyrthosiphon pisum is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). Aphis craccivora in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and Ac. pisum were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, Vicia faba L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in H. defensa in Ac. pisum and APSE type 4 was found in H. defensa in Ap. craccivora. Aphid lines without H. defensa were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on V. fava plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of H. defensa from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from Ap. craccivora and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from Ac. craccivora were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of H. defensa and APSE prior to assays.    Aphelinus atriplicis was collected as mummified Diuraphis noxia on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; A. glycinis was collected as mummified Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. Aphelinus glycinis was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); A. atriplicis was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the Aphelinus varipes complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. Aphelinus atriplicis was reared on D. noxia on barley, Hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae); Aphelinus glycinis was reared on Aphis glycines on soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of D. noxia was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of A. glycines was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither D. noxia nor A. glycines are known to harbor H. defensa, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of H. defensa in our colonies of these species. Although A. glycines harbors another bacterium, Arsenophonus, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.    Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with Hamiltonella defensa versus uninfected aphids    To measure the effect of infection with H. defensa harboring APSE on parasitism of Ap. craccivora and Ac. craccivora, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of Aphelinus atriplicis or Aphelinus glycinis that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with H. defensa or uninfected aphids on V. faba variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. Aphelinus females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.    The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.    Aphids parasitized by these Aphelinus species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.    Design structure    The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for Aphelinus glycinis on Ap. craccivora and Aphelinus atriplicis on Ap. craccivora and on Ac. pisum (24 each for Hamiltonella-infected versus uninfected aphids)."

Major agricultural pollutants include bacterial pathogens and nutrients that originate from animal wastes. Several concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are located in close proximity to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma; it is our understanding that these facilities are not US EPA registered. The goal of this study was to survey refuge surface water and sediment for known bacterial pathogens of wildlife, especially waterfowl, which may have originated from CAFO wastes. Sampling was conducted during the spring, summer, and fall of 2001 and 2002 at ten sites located on watersheds downstream of agricultural sites. Bacterial indicators of fecal contamination (fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci) were identified and counted in surface water samples. Fecal coliform levels exceeded US EPA human recreational bathing water limits in 22 of 50 samples, and fecal streptococcus numbers exceeded human recreational bathing limits in 47 of 50 samples. Antibiotic resistance profiles were determined for a subset of fecal colifom and fecal streptococcus isolates. The tested isolates were frequently resistant to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, and tetracycline, antibiotics commonly administered to livestock. In addition, surface water and sediment samples were analyzed for the presence of bacteria (Clostridium botulinum type C, toxigenic Escherichia coli, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella spp., and Yersinia spp) with pathogenic potential to wild and domestic animals. Of the organisms surveyed, salmonellae and escherichiae were isolated. The data presented herein will provide a benchmark for future studies investigating the potential long term environmental effects of agricultural practices on the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge."

Best nutrient management practices are critical for maintaining profitable economic returns, sustaining higher yields, lowering environmental impacts, optimizing nutritional quality, and providing ecosystem services. Best management practices that improve nutrient use efficiencies can reduce nutrient losses from agricultural systems. However, we need to improve our understanding of biological, physical and chemical influences on nutrient processes. For instance, crop use efficiency of nitrogen (N), the primary macronutrient regulating yield and protein content, can be reduced by processes such as denitrification (N2O and N2 emission), leaching (NH4-N, NO3-N, and organic-N), ammonia (NH3-N,) volatilization, surface runoff and erosion, disease, and non-crop competition. Similarly, we need to obtain more information about biological and physical cycles of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), including factors that influence nutrient availability from fertilizers, crop residues, cover crops, manures, and other byproducts. We need a better understanding of relationships between soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates, and availability and uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients.  In addition, we need information regarding how these practices impact yields, organoleptic qualities, and the macro- and micro-nutritional composition of plants.  This information will improve our ability to develop best nutrient management practices.    Optimal soil nutrient levels are critical for maximizing economic returns, increasing sustainable yields, lowering environmental impacts, sustaining ecosystem services and optimizing nutritional and organoleptic qualities of human and animal foods. Efficient management practices are crucial for increasing economic returns for land managers in a sustainable manner while producing high quality of food for animals and humans with reduced off-site transfer of nutrients from agricultural areas in watersheds. Optimizing N and P inputs requires more information about nutrient inputs from fertilizers, manures, composts, agricultural byproducts, cover crops, and other nutrient sources in addition to nutrient cycling within soils.  This requires data from long-term nutrient management studies across a wide range of soils, crops, and environmental conditions. Land management needs are to connect nutrient management practices for crops with nutrient use efficiency; crop quality; crop chemical composition and nutritional value, quality and acceptability for animal and human health.  Development of databases that enable the scientific exploration of connections among data generated from diverse research efforts such as nutrient management, fate and ecosystem service outcomes, nutritional composition of crops, and animal and human health, is needed.    Nitrogen is a key nutrient that enhances agricultural yield and protein content, but multiple N loss pathways, as previously mentioned, reduce crop N use efficiency (NUE). Implementing proper management practices is needed to reduce N losses from agricultural systems. ARS has multidisciplinary scientific teams with expertise in soils, ecological engineering, hydrology, livestock management and nutrition, horticulture, crop breeding, human and animal nutrition, post-harvest management and processing, and other areas, and intentional collaboration among these teams offers opportunities to rapidly improve NUE and crop quality and reduce off-site N losses.    Similarly, increased P use efficiencies are needed to enhance and ensure sustainable agricultural production and to reduce environmental degradation of water sources. Manure is a valuable source of P and it can be used as a soil amendment to reduce crop production costs. However, there is a need to improve our understanding of the biological and physical cycles of soil P, as well as to obtain more information about P supplies from fertilizer, crop residues, cover crops, manure, and byproducts, and livestock nutrition impacts on manure properties.    There is also a need for a better understanding of soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates and how their interactions with crops and community ecology affect yield and the uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients and the ultimate nutritional composition and organoleptic qualities of the crop. Studies documenting the responses of crop-associated biological communities to management practices and genetic technologies implemented across multiple environments (e.g., soil types and chemistries, hydrologic regimes, climates) will improve our understanding of gaps in macro- and micro-nutrient management strategies.    A goal of the USDA-ARS is to increase agricultural production and quality while reducing environmental impacts. The Nutrient Uptake and Outcomes (NUOnet) database will be able to help establish baselines on nutrient use efficiencies; processes contributing to nutrient losses; and processes contributing to optimal crop yield, nutritional and organoleptic quality. This national database could be used to calculate many different environmental indicators from a comprehensive understanding of nutrient stocks and flows. Increasing our understanding of stocks and flows could help in the identification of knowledge gaps as well as areas where increased efficiencies can be achieved at a national level. NUOnet could also be used to develop tools to derive cost-benefit curves associated with nutrient management improvement scenarios and assess local, regional and national impacts of off-site nutrient loss. Understanding how agricultural production impacts human health is a challenge, and the database could be used to link crop management strategies to crop chemical composition to human consumption patterns and ultimately to human health outcomes. A national database will also be very important for development and evaluation of new technologies such as real-time sensing or other proximal and remote sensing technologies that enable assessment of nutrient use efficiencies, particularly at the grower level. The database could also be used to develop analyses that will contribute to the recommendation of policies for resource allocations that will most effectively fulfill the goals of the Grand Challenge. Such a national database with contributions from peers across different national programs could also enhance collaborations between ARS, universities, and extension specialists, as well as with producers, industry, and other partners.    See the NUOnet Home Page for more information about this database and strategic goals."

It simultaneously aims to measure impacts and compare and contrast how the grants operate, both in terms of how similar programs operate in different contexts within Indonesia and in terms of how programs with different approaches to electrification and community engagement operate. It chiefly investigates changes in energy consumption, energy expenditure, economic opportunity, and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of exposure to a solar photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid that is owned and operated by a community-level Special Purpose Vehicle in treatment villages and sub-villages of the East Sumba and Berau regencies. This report describes baseline conditions of these outcomes of interest and assesses the validity of the project logic in the context of these conditions.To do so it will employ a quasi-experimental methodology in East Sumba combining statistical matching and difference-in-difference analysis techniques as well as non-experimental quantitative and qualitative pre/post performance evaluation methodologies in both East Sumba and Berau.  At baseline, we find the use of solar technology (typically 20 watts or less) more prevalent in East Sumba than in Berau, where individual or shared generators are often used. Although households in East Sumba have access to electricity for more of the day (9.2 vs. 5.3 hours), households in East Sumba consume significantly more diesel and gasoline and have more electric lighting fixtures lit per hour than are lit in East Sumba, such that each regency consumes around 27 lamp-hours per day of electric lighting. Households in Berau spend more on energy absolutely and as a percent of total income, although they are over twice as wealthy on average as households in East Sumba. Our findings lend support to the notion that access to the micro-grids is likely to increase the consumption of energy and decrease expenditure, although the latter outcome is more likely in places like Berau where baseline fuel consumption and expenditure is high than in East Sumba, where it is already low. The validity of this assumption will depend on the increase in electrical capacity from access to the micro-grid relative to other solar sources (between 400 and 900 watts at minimum depending on the regency) allowing households to substitute away from diesel-powered generators, which they currently must use to supplement low-capacity solar home systems.  We find that, with respect to increased economic opportunity, although local enterprises are keen to utilize newly available renewable energy for marginal improvements to their businesses, primarily local economies in each site are likely to preclude any more than marginal changes in economic outcomes of interest such as occupational income, income from transformed agricultural products, and time spent on income generating activity. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, we find baseline emissions to total 41.00 tons CO2e/month in East Sumba and 44.08 tons CO2e/month in Berau after accounting for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene consumed per month by each household in treatment areas and additional diesel contributed to communities in-kind for community generators from nearby extractive industry corporate social responsibility programs. Similar to energy expenditures, there is more potential for this figure to decrease in Berau, where fuel consumption is high at baseline, than in East Sumba, where fuel consumption per household is already low.  Finally, we assessed the potential for the SPV approach to render the projects sustainable over the long-term. To this end, we find strong community and grantee engagement and capacity for local governance to reflect positively on the potential for sustainability, although there is concern by many stakeholders that the grantees may not remain engaged long enough to transfer the necessary human capacity to villagers for operation and maintenance of the SPV and the micro-grid. Future data collection efforts will observe how the SPV interacts with obstacles and how engaged the respective parties remain.  To assess the validity of our own experimental design in the context of our baseline data, we re-ran our power analysis with our primary data, assessed our treatment and control groups for balance, and conducted a preliminary matching exercise. We find that, barring significant losses from contamination or pruning, we retain sufficient power to detect outcomes of interest. Treatment and comparison groups differ on key covariates, specifically related to wealth and remoteness, but they are equivalent even prior to matching on outcomes of interest such as energy access and electric lighting consumption. Matching techniques are able to eliminate as many as 1/3 of the significant differences detected. Although remaining differences and potential contamination remain risks to our experimental design, these should be mitigated by difference-in-difference analysis techniques and oversampling of control households."

The presence and spread of these genes in non-clinical and non-agricultural environments has created the need for background investigations to enhance our understanding of the magnitude and risks associated with this emerging field (Allen and others, 2010). The current global economic costs of antibiotic resistant microorganisms is about 5.8 trillion USD, which is approximately equivalent to the combined GDP of Germany and the United Kingdom (Taylor and others, 2014). In this study researchers screened soil and sediment samples for the presence of 15 antibiotic resistance gene targets and 5 species of Vibrio (a marker of marine inundation) to determine natural background concentrations. These data provide a foundation to address background prevalence of these genetic targets in the northeastern United States (U.S.) to address regional influences (sources of pollutants) and to contrast future influences due to sea-level rise and large scale storms."

Current and potential SCINet users are using and generating very large datasets so SCINet needs to be provisioned with adequate data storage for their active computing. It is not designed to hold data beyond active research phases. At the same time, the National Agricultural Library has been developing the Ag Data Commons, a research data catalog and repository designed for public data release and professional data curation. Ag Data Commons needs to anticipate the size and nature of data it will be tasked with handling.    The ARS Web-enabled Databases Working Group, organized under the SCINet initiative, conducted a study to establish baseline data storage needs and practices, and to make projections that could inform future infrastructure design, purchases, and policies. The SCINet Web-enabled Databases Working Group helped develop the survey which is the basis for an internal report. While the report was for internal use, the survey and resulting data may be generally useful and are being released publicly.    From October 24 to November 8, 2016 we administered a 17-question survey (Appendix A) by emailing a Survey Monkey link to all ARS Research Leaders, intending to cover data storage needs of all 1,675 SY (Category 1 and Category 4) scientists. We designed the survey to accommodate either individual researcher responses or group responses. Research Leaders could decide, based on their unit's practices or their management preferences, whether to delegate response to a data management expert in their unit, to all members of their unit, or to themselves collate responses from their unit before reporting in the survey.    Larger storage ranges cover vastly different amounts of data so the implications here could be significant depending on whether the true amount is at the lower or higher end of the range. Therefore, we requested more detail from \"Big Data users,\" those 47 respondents who indicated they had more than 10 to 100 TB or over 100 TB total current data (Q5).  All other respondents are called \"Small Data users.\" Because not all of these follow-up requests were successful, we used actual follow-up responses to estimate likely responses for those who did not respond.    We defined active data as data that would be used within the next six months. All other data would be considered inactive, or archival.    To calculate per person storage needs we used the high end of the reported range divided by 1 for an individual response, or by G, the number of individuals in a group response. For Big Data users we used the actual reported values or estimated likely values."

To better understand and assess these impacts, a spatial database will be developed to provide a regional characterization of areas at risk to PTD. Spatial information in conjunction with existing data and models will be used to make preliminary projections on the effects of PTD on cosystem services such as duck production, water storage and water quality. Spatial information will be used to identify study sites that will be instrumented to quantify and model the effects of PTD systems on wetland hydrology; this information is critical for refinement and calibration of model projections. The spatial database developed through this project and field studies will benefit other projects addressing PTD and hydrological issues in the PPP LCC. Ultimately, this work will provide the first assessment on the impacts PTD on ecosystem services as well as provide the underpinning for future development of decision support tools for private, state, federal and NGO stakeholders.  Two seasonal wetland catchments were selected in Stutsman County, North Dakota. Study catchments at Beck WPA will be tiled, and study catchments at Roosevelt WPA will not.

Background information on nonpoint source pollution is provided as well as general guidelines on preventing contamination. The handbook begins by introducing safe handling of suspected chemical pollution in wetlands. The description and general uses of agricultural chemicals are discussed next. Major pathways of chemical contamination and effects of pesticides are also covered. This handbook provides technical guidelines for evaluating non-point source contamination of wetlands by agricultural chemicals. The handbook is intended to be a convenient, useful, and comprehensive reference for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel involved in the evaluation of agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands and migratory birds. The handbook also stresses the safety of individuals investigating possible chemical contamination. It is designed to be a ready reference during the planning phase of investigations of agricultural chemical impacts on wetlands. While practices included here are designed for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel, other cooperating agencies or groups may find the information useful when performing similar duties. The handbook may provide guidance to landowners and others wishing to minimize chemical impacts on wildlife as well as provide advice on best management practices. Information in the handbook is based on Federal laws, Executive orders, regulations, Department of Interior policies, and results of scientific research. This handbook has been prepared by the South Dakota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Division for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Offices.

Some isolates exhibit increased heat tolerance, a concern for food safety. Analysis of a finished-quality genome sequence of an isolate commonly used in heat resistance studies, S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Senftenberg 775W (ATCC 43845), demonstrated an interesting observation that this strain contains not just one, but two horizontally acquired thermotolerance locus homologs. These two loci reside on a large 341.3-kbp plasmid that is similar to the well-studied IncHI2 R478 plasmid but lacks any antibiotic resistance genes found on R478 or other IncHI2 plasmids. As this historical Salmonella isolate has been in use since 1941, comparative analysis of the plasmid and of the thermotolerance loci contained on the plasmid will provide insight into the evolution of heat resistance loci as well as acquisition of resistance determinants in IncHI2 plasmids."

This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.    Purpose    As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.    An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the Ag Data Commons, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to  establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals    compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms    determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data    ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data  Approach    The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.    Search methods    We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of \u201cagricultural data\u201d /\u201cag data\u201d / \u201cscientific data\u201d + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.    We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of \u201cagriculture\u201d, \u201cag data\u201d and \u201cuniversity\u201d to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University \u2013 International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis \u2013 Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.    Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.    Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.    Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.    Evaluation    We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.    We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.    Results    A summary of the major findings from our data review:  Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.    There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.    Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation."

As is frequently the case for large scale infrastructure projects, it was not feasible to randomly select the roads that would be rehabilitated in the MCA RRRP from amongst the eligible. Instead, MCA planned to fund projects based on estimated economic rates of return (ERRs). The ERR is calculated from several inputs, including the vehicular traffic, vehicle operating costs, and the cost of the project, among others. An ERR was estimated for each of the road links under consideration for rehabilitation, and in order to be funded, a road\u2019s ERR had to meet or exceed 12.5 percent. However, the MCC Board subsequently made the decision to discontinue funding any further road construction and rehabilitation under the Compact due to concerns about Armenia's democratic governance. Starting in 2009, the Armenian government instead accessed loans from the World Bank to rehabilitate many road sections that were included in the RRRP plans before MCC discontinued funding, using and updating the road project designs developed by MCA-Armenia. These roads were selected based on estimated ERRs as well as other factors such as the size of the population who would benefit.  The evaluation of rural road rehabilitation uses a comparison group design. The evaluation design identifies the counterfactual by defining a comparison group of roads selected from those initially proposed by MCA that share similar characteristics as those selected by the World Bank, but that were not rehabilitated. The evaluators adopted a hybrid approach that matches road links based on a limited number of key observable characteristics and then uses regression modeling to control for other characteristics that may impact outcomes. The most fundamental criterion used in identifying potential comparison roads is that it is among the roads that were originally considered for rehabilitation by MCA, indicating that the road conditions are poor enough to consider rehabilitation.   The data for this evaluation  come from Armenia\u2019s Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS), an annual household survey fielded by Armenia\u2019s National Statistical Service (NSS). MCA funded a considerable increase in the rural sample, which was in part aimed at facilitating the RRRP evaluation. The sampling plans were developed and implemented based on the evaluation design described above. The evaluation includes households served by 27 roads that were rehabilitated with World Bank financing based on designs funded by MCA and 28 comparison roads."

The process evaluation will draw from primary qualitative data collected from national and local stakeholders and households on several islands in 2018 and 2020, a review of project documents, and administrative data provided by government agencies and \u00c1guas de Santiago (AdS), a new corporatized, multi-municipal water utility for the island of Santiago.  2) Pre-post analyses of household survey data and secondary data from utilities (including AdS), which will explore changes in outcomes on the island of Santiago in the first few years after the project activities are completed.   3) Case studies of three infrastructure projects funded by the project's Water and Sanitation Fund (FASA), on the islands of Santiago, Sal, and S\u00e3o Vicente, which will explore potential commonalities and unique aspects of projects that represent the broader portfolio. The two rounds of case studies will synthesize    information from all of the data sources used in the other two components of the evaluation, with additional primary qualitative data related specifically to these three projects.  The evaluation of the WASH project seeks to answer the following questions proposed by MCC:          Were the Activities/Sub-Activities implemented as designed? What were implementation challenges and successes?          How did the political and economic incentives of different sector actors affect the implementation, sustainability, and efficacy of the WASH project? In particular, how did these incentives affect the reform portfolio, and the effects of the WASH project on customers, utilities, and the management efficiency of the sector?         a) Has the FASA mechanism efficiently selected the most effective, high quality projects as measured by the effects of the FASA projects on the socioeconomic well-being of households, the finances and management of the utilities, economy value-added and business and household productivity? b) Is the FASA a sustainable institution in Cabo Verde that is and will catalyze additional financing for WASH infrastructure?          a) Is the new tariff for AdS pro-poor (progressive), regressive, or neutral? b) Does the new tariff structure allow for cost-recovery by AdS?          Is there evidence that the interventions have resulted in the outcomes outlined in the program logic?          Was the WASH project as a whole effective at increasing the management efficiency and sustainability of the sector as measured by non-revenue water, collection ratio, and tariff adequacy? At reducing the (implicit) subsidy to the WASH sector at the municipal and national level?          What has been the effect of the WASH project on access to, quality and continuity of, and total costs of (direct and indirect) water and sanitation services for households and businesses in Cabo Verde? On gender and social equality in access to and cost of water and sanitation services?          How do the FASA and the Social Access Fund for Water and Sanitation Connection (FAS) projects' effects on these outcomes compare?     More details can be found in the evaluation design report: Null, Clair, Audrey-Marie Moore, Edith Felix, and Chantal Toledo. \"The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Project in Cabo Verde: Evaluation Design Report.\" Report submitted to the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Washington, DC: Mathematica Policy Research, January 2018."

                "text": "Malawi - Infrastructure Development Social Impact was contracted by MCC to develop and conduct an evaluation of the Malawi Compact. Specifically, SI has been tasked to \u201cassess the program design and implementation to develop the most rigorous evaluation design feasible, whether it is a performance or impact evaluation, and identify the most appropriate evaluation methodology feasible given the context.\u201d     Efforts to identify a research design that would allow for a rigorously defined counterfactual were unsuccessful, and as a result this design document outlines plans for a rigorous performance evaluation that will aim to measure key outcome indicators early on in the Compact, midway through, and at the end of the Compact, as well as track changes over time. This evaluation is designed to address the core questions of the evaluation (Table 1) Since the proposed design is a performance evaluation, it is important to note that it may not be possible to state with confidence how the power sector in Malawi has changed (or not changed) as a result of the Compact, as it will not be possible to control for other potential causes of change. In some cases, however, it may be feasible to identify and potentially rule out alternative explanations.    The inability to define a counterfactual requires a reformulation of some of the initial evaluation questions originally proposed by MCC, including some core questions included in the SI-MCC contract. In addition, the Evaluation Assessment Report revealed that both SI and MCC had substantial concerns with regard to the original research questions proposed in Social Impact's contract. This is natural given the way that interventions change over time, and that the proposed questions should be feasible to answer based on the data that can be collected as part of the evaluation. Based on SI's comprehensive desk review, information gathered during the scoping trip, and frequent communication with MCC and MCA-M, the SI evaluation team has developed research questions and research approaches for the IDP project components, as proposed in Table 2. The original questions and the suggested modifications for each question are presented in the Appendix.   Research Questions    Through a rigorous performance evaluation, the evaluation design aims to answer the following core evaluation questions and several complementary research questions:         What declines in poverty, increases in economic growth, reductions in the electricity related cost of doing business, increases in access to electricity, and increases in value added production are observed over the life of the Compact?         What were the results of the interventions - intended and unintended, positive or negative?         Are there differences in outcomes of interest by gender, age and income? Sex and income disaggregated information for businesses and households will be pursued to the extent possible.         What are the lessons learned and are they applicable to other similar projects?         What is the likelihood that the results of the Project will be sustained over time?         At the household level, the evaluations shall focus on the following program/project/activities impacts on household and individuals: income; expenditures, consumption and access to energy; individual time devoted to leisure and productive activities.          At the enterprise level, the evaluation shall focus on the potential impact of the program/project/activities on: business profitability and productivity; value added production and investment; employment and wage changes; energy consumption and sources of energy used; business losses.          At the regulatory, institutional and policy level, the evaluation shall explore the potential impacts of the program/project/activities on: utility operating costs and losses; financial sustainability; private investment, particularly in generation; expansion of electricity access for customers, particularly the poor.    To answer these questions, the evaluation design will leverage diverse research methodologies with different timelines for data collection. The evaluation design can be broken into three main parts, albeit with some overlap:   \u00b7 IDP evaluation: The IDP design focuses primarily on an intensive metering effort to measure the technical benefits of the project, including changes in energy delivered, outages, and quality. This will be complemented by focus groups with residents of beneficiary communities.     \u00b7 Enterprise survey: A panel survey of businesses will be used to evaluate both the PSRP and the IDP.   IDP Evaluation Design    Design Overview    We propose that the IDP evaluation consist of two major parts: (1) intensive metering to determine technical benefits, and (2) focus group discussions with beneficiaries. In addition, some of the activities conducted as part of the PSRP evaluation - specifically work flow analyses of response to outages - will also address IDP benefits made possible by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems."

(2) How was the activity implemented? (3) Did the activity produce its desired results, and what is the extent of the relevant evidence? (4) What was learned about supporting enterprise development and how sustainable are MCC's efforts in this area? and (5) What are the lessons for MCC and other stakeholders from the design and implementation of this activity?    This analysis relies on a mixed-methods approach, in which Mathematica staff collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data from a variety of sources, including administrative records, programmatic reports, and stakeholder interviews. In July 2012, Mathematica staff conducted interviews with MCC, FOMILENIO, Chemonics, and technical service provider staff, as well as members of FOMILENIO's board of directors, an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, representatives from S\u00faper Selectos (a major grocery store chain in El Salvador), PBS participants, and representatives from FOMILENIO-supported enterprises. To formulate primary findings and conclusions, Mathematica staff triangulated qualitative information provided by all interviewed stakeholders and analyzed this information in conjunction with administrative reports and records.  Interim Impact Evaluation:    The Productive Development Project (PDP) was one of three large-scale projects financed under the 2006 compact between the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of El Salvador. The main objective of the PDP was to assist in the development of profitable and sustainable business ventures for poor individuals in El Salvador's Northern Zone. Between 2008 and 2012, the PDP used nearly $72 million in allocated funds to serve over 13,500 participants and create more than 11,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The PDP comprised three activities: Production and Business Services (PBS), Investment Support, and Financial Services. The PBS Activity -- the subject of this impact evaluation and the largest of the three activities -- provided technical and material assistance to farmers and small-scale producers to support the Northern Zone's dairy, fruit, horticulture, handicrafts, tourism, forestry, and coffee sectors.  The design for the impact evaluation of the PBS Activity is a randomized rollout design, in which some producers were offered PBS assistance several months before other producers were offered similar assistance. The goal of this design is to attain the highest level of rigor possible without significantly altering existing implementation plans. The evaluation is limited to three value chains: (1) handicrafts, (2) dairy, and (3) horticulture. Among all value chains in the PBS, these three chains were most amenable to random assignment, and were expected to yield impacts in the one-year interim timeline specified for the evaluation.   Treatment groups were offered PBS assistance in the first implementation phase (beginning in late 2009 for handicrafts and mid-2010 in the case of the dairy and horticulture chains) and control groups in the dairy and horticulture chains were offered PBS assistance roughly one year after the treatment group. As over 15,000 individuals had participated in the PBS Activity by August 2012, this evaluation sample of 1,736 individuals (518, 593, and 625 in the dairy, horticulture, and handicrafts chains, respectively) includes only 11 percent of the individuals served under the activity."

Habitat use and behavior of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) wer2 studied from 27 June-11 August 1.982 and 24 May-29 August 1983, in the Caribou Pass/Kongakut River area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Data are presented as bear-unit hours. A bear-unit was defined as one bear, a family unit, or a male bear with consort(s). Bear densities are low on the study area (1 bear/130-260 km2). Intensive searching for bears resulted in the collection of 387 bear-unit hours of behavioral information. Six categories (21 sub-categories) were used to describe behavior. Bears were most often observed feeding, foraging, or resting (114,113, and 88 bear-unit hours, respectively). The most common food items were Hedysarum alpinum (roots), 1 Equisetum arvense, Boykinia richardsonii (flowers and leaves), berries (Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Arctostaphylos rubra), caribou (Rangifer tarandus), ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) and microtines. Most use of caribou by bears occurs on the coastal plain at or near the caribou calving grounds. Grizzlies shift their ranges to include areas frequented by caribou. For about 1 month (24 May-21 June) caribou (especially calves) are an important food item for grizzlies. Habitat types were described by the dominant topographic and vegetative feature. A total of 398 bear-unit hours was collected concerning habitat use. Bears were observed in 6 topographic types. Valley flats, mountain slope/hillside, and cutbank/gulley/creek were the most common topographic types used (107, 90, and 89 bear-unit hours, respectively). A different vegetation classification system was used in 1982 than 1983. Results from 1982 are being converted to the 1983 system. In 1983 bears we're observed in 20 vegetation types. Sedge tussock mixed-shrub tundra, sedge-willow tundra, and mixed-shrub tundra were the most common vegetation types used."

                "text": "Tanzania - Kigoma Solar The performance evaluation of the Kigoma solar activity was designed to answer questions about the implementation of the program and about outcomes that may have been affected by the program. Specifically, the evaluation sought to answer the following questions:     1. How was the Kigoma solar activity implemented?    2. How did outcomes differ at follow-up and change over time for the targeted group selected to receive the Kigoma solar activity versus the nontargeted group?  We sought to answer the first question by examining several implementation domains: (1) implementation processes and experience with the program, (2) installation of MCA-T-funded solar systems, and (3) service quality of solar systems. To answer the second question, we examined several performance domains: (1) electric and non-electric energy consumption and expenditures, (2) investment and economic activities, (3) human capital accumulation, and (4) economic growth.   The evaluation covered all seven types of potential beneficiaries of this activity, and included respondents selected to participate in the activity (targeted respondents) and a comparison group of respondents who were not selected to participate (nontargeted respondents). Nontargeted respondents were selected from distinct geographic areas to minimize the possibility of contamination. No additional efforts were made to select nontargeted respondents to be similar to targeted respondents; as a result these two groups of respondents may differ in significant ways on characteristics that might affect our outcomes of interest. The beneficiary types are (1) schools, (2) health centers, (3) dispensaries, (4) businesses in village markets, (5) fishers, (6) businesses that received loans from local credit institutions to purchase solar systems, and (7) households that received loans from local credit institutions for solar systems.   To address the first research question, covering implementation, we looked at differences in the implementation outcomes between the targeted and nontargeted groups and changes over time in those outcomes. We also examined changes in solar PV use between the interim survey and the follow-up survey among all targeted respondents. In addition, we compared the use and service quality of MCA-T and non-MCA-T PV systems at follow-up, comparing all MCA-T users with all non-MCA-T users, regardless of their group assignment. Last, we examined the challenges and benefits of participation in the Kigoma solar activity among those who reported using MCA-T systems at follow-up.   To address the second research question, covering outcomes in the performance domains, we compared outcomes between the targeted and nontargeted groups and analyzed how key outcomes changed over time. For most outcomes, this meant looking at change between the interim and follow-up surveys. We calculated an adjusted difference at follow-up and a \"net change,\" which is defined as the difference between targeted and nontargeted groups at follow-up minus the difference between targeted and nontargeted groups at interim. This is similar to a difference-in-difference analysis. In some cases, we collected information during the follow-up survey that was not collected during the first round of data collection. For these questions, we present only differences between the targeted and nontargeted groups at follow-up.  The performance evaluation utilized data collected from an interim survey (2013) and data from a follow-up survey (2015). The follow-up data are provided in this package. Key findings related to implementation include:   Implementation generally occurred according to plan, but some key implementation challenges, such as the apparent limited use of an SMS marketing component and the lack of participation by surveyed fishers, limited our ability to evaluate some components of the activity.   Solar PV use was common among those who received MCC-funded systems.   As use of solar PV systems grows, so do expectations for their performance and capacity.    Solar PV systems face quality issues, and a lack of maintenance and repair training may limit their utility and popularity.     Key findings related to performance include:   The use of solar PV systems increased over time, among both targeted and nontargeted respondents, and was consistently high in the targeted group at interim and follow-up.    Liquid fuel use was lower among targeted respondents than nontargeted respondents both at interim and at follow-up.   Findings from the performance domains provide limited evidence of association between the Kigoma solar activity and improvements in outcomes related to investments, economic activities, and human capital accumulation for specific beneficiary types.

                "text": "Zambia - Innovation Grant - Zambian Breweries Grantee The performance evaluation of Zambian Breweries' Manja Pamodzi program examines how Zambian Breweries is performing in relation to its key objectives, which are to create a sustainable collection-and-recycling value chain for post-consumer packaging waste; formalize largely informal networks of collectors and aggregators (by providing them with the tools and capacity to collect greater quantities of recyclables); and reduce the amount of waste in Lusaka. To understand Zambian Breweries' overall performance, we examined program activities, program assumptions, mechanisms of change, and outputs. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the fidelity of program implementation and to learn whether program delivery deviated from the original plan and how those deviations affected program outputs. We also explored changes in outcomes, although the outcome analysis for collectors is descriptive rather than focused on program impacts. We were not able to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the program due to the lack of baseline data and the small sample of waste collectors.     The research questions driving this evaluation fall into six main topics related to program processes: (1) the start-up process; (2) community campaigns and outreach; (3) collectors' recruitment and experience; (4) aggregators' recruitment and experience; (5) processors' capacity and needs; and (6) waste in the environment. We examined how Manja Pamodzi engaged stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle; how collectors, aggregators, and processors experienced the program; and whether and how Manja Pamodzi changed collectors' livelihoods and improved waste management practices in communities.     Research questions per each program process    1.  The Start-Up Process     \u00b7   What was the process of working with relevant stakeholders in starting up the program?    \u00b7   How was the price set?    2.  Community campaigns and outreach     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct waste collector community clean-up sensitization, and to what extent were communities being sensitized on the benefits of recycling?    \u00b7   What messages were used during the campaign? Which were perceived to be emphasized? And which were perceived to be more effective?    \u00b7   How has the Manja Pamodzi program engaged with schools to encourage effective waste management practices?    3.  Collectors' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How did Zambian Breweries conduct recruitment, training of collectors and capacity building?    \u00b7   What program gaps exist that discourage waste collectors from joining and from becoming dedicated collectors?    \u00b7   What types of persons are interested in becoming collectors, and what types of persons are likely to continue being successful collectors? What are the characteristics associated with being successful and productive?    \u00b7   What has been waste collectors' experience in collecting recyclables?    \u00b7   What does a typical day of waste collection look like? What processes could be improved to make the collectors' experience more productive?    4.  Aggregators' recruitment and experience     \u00b7   How were aggregators' sites set up? Who signed up to be aggregators? How were aggregators supported by the Manja Pamodzi program?    \u00b7   How effective do the aggregators find the biometric machines? What are the main challenges experienced during the process of receiving recyclables from collectors?    \u00b7   What are the main challenges experienced during the process of transferring waste from aggregator plants to processor plants?    5.  Processors' capacity and needs     \u00b7   How has Manja Pamodzi changed the demand for recyclables and for recyclables byproducts?    \u00b7   Are processors able to receive enough sorted plastic and paper?    6.  Collectors' Income and Livelihood     \u00b7   How do collectors spend and use the income coming from sale of recyclables?    \u00b7   What does the employment and income history look like for collectors, before and after they became collectors?    \u00b7   In terms of income, what kinds of jobs is a collector's comparable to, given the setting and the profile of the collector's job?    \u00b7   What are the perceptions of the dignity of the job among community members and among collectors?    7.  Waste in the environment     \u00b7   From where are most recyclables collected? What types of places, and what are the hazards associated with accumulation of waste in those places?    \u00b7   What is the perceived change of the program on waste accumulation?  AIR investigated the evaluation questions above through several quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors (both active and inactive male and female collectors), focus group discussions (FGDs) with active and inactive male and female collectors and local students, key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant program stakeholders, and a time-motion study to investigate the \u201ctypical day\u201d of a Manja Pamodzi waste collector as well as overall waste collection efficiency. Data collected through these methods were bolstered by and triangulated with official program documents obtained from Zambian Breweries Plc. and the Millennium Challenge Account-Zambia (MCA-Z).   Summary of Main Findings    Community Campaign, Outreach, and Experience    Zambian Breweries Plc. continued to conduct sensitization events with communities throughout Lusaka and nearly always met and exceeded sensitization targets. The program missed its quarterly sensitization targets between December 2017 and February 2018-due to the cholera outbreak in the city that forced ZB Plc. to temporarily halt waste collection activities like DCPs-but cumulatively met its sensitization targets, owing to a major uptick in sensitization efforts between March and August 2017.  Between R1 and R2, the sensitization process remained largely the same. In an effort to garner community-level support for Manja Pamodzi, ZB Plc. continued to conduct community engagement events throughout Lusaka-including DCPs, community sensitization meetings, and thematic workshops at local schools-and promoted the program through radio, TV, newspaper, and social media advertisements.   While Manja Pamodzi met its sensitization targets throughout the program lifecycle, qualitative and quantitative data collected in R2 show that community members were marginally less aware of Manja Pamodzi during the second round of data collection when compared to the first round.  The Aggregator Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Aggregator Recruitment    Zambian Breweries Plc. adopted several strategies to identify aggregators, but struggled to recruit female aggregators throughout the program. .  A key barrier to recruiting female aggregators was the preference for selecting aggregators with previous business and waste management experience.   Aggregator Capacity Building and Site Set-Up    Aggregators reported that Zambian Breweries Plc.'s general and entrepreneurship trainings improved their overall site set-up experience, but believed that the monthly aggregator meetings were less effective.   ZB Plc. also assisted aggregators with identifying land and setting up operations for aggregation sites, but still faced challenges procuring land for permanent sites and establishing electrical connections at sites.   Challenges Faced by Aggregators    MP aggregators believed transporting waste, collector retention, and providing payment to waste collectors upon receipt of waste represented their main challenges.   The Collector Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Similar to the first round of data collection, married, female heads of households who engaged in waste collection in addition to other types of work constituted the majority of Manja Pamodzi waste collectors.   Collector Recruitment and Capacity Building    Most Manja Pamodzi collectors were recruited through DCPs, aggregators, or social networks, highlighting the need for both formal and informal recruitment efforts. Once recruited, collectors are supposed to receive training about proper waste collection practices and a set of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear while collecting waste. Similar to the first round of data collection, 73% of men and 60% of women received some form of training, but 39% of collectors reported receiving no formal training or capacity building under Manja Pamodzi.  The provision of official safety gear was another major component of Zambian Breweries Plc.'s recruitment and training process, and survey data indicate that more collectors in R2 received PPE than in R1. Compared to R1, more collectors received gloves, work suits, and boots in the second round of data collection. Despite these improvements, all collectors were to receive PPE under the program, and only 44% of collectors received gloves, 45% received work suits, and 31% received boots in R2. Despite some gains in collectors' receipt of PPE, frequent collector turnover meant that aggregators were often reluctant to provide PPE to collectors until they demonstrated a commitment to the waste collection. When asked how ZB Plc. addressed the selective distribution of PPE to collectors, staff mentioned that they encouraged aggregators to improve their tracking of collectors so that aggregators could locate an inactive collector and retrieve lost PPE. At the time of this report, it is unclear whether these efforts have been implemented by aggregators.  Waste Collection Strategies    Similar to the first round of data collection, waste collectors typically start their work day early in the morning and collect for anywhere from four to six hours each day. Collectors spend significant amounts of time walking between sites to collect waste and a major portion of productive time is lost due to walking. For male and female collectors, common sites to collect waste included rubbish heaps or dump sites, drainage areas, markets, the local university, and sports stadiums. Collectors often adopted several strategies to ensure they collected adequate quantities of waste including: collecting waste early in the day (before other collectors had the opportunity to collect waste or before recyclables were destroyed), developing partnerships with individuals who could alert a collector of large amounts of accumulated waste, collecting waste that was more valuable or less likely to decompose if stored for extended periods of time, hiring others to collect waste for them, and collecting recyclables at strategic sites where a large amount of recyclables could be found (e.g., bars, landfills, markets, universities, etc.).   Challenges Faced by Collectors    Low pay and a lack of protective gear were cited most often as the main challenges facing collectors. Among those who dropped out of the program, 47% reported that low pay was the primary reason for leaving Manja Pamodzi. Relatedly, when asked why others do not join the program, 59% of those surveyed noted that the lack of adequate pay was a major deterrent to prospective collectors, though this represents a slight drop since the first round of data collection (where 66% reported low pay as the reason others do not become waste collectors).  Collectors also mentioned lack of storage and transportation as major program challenges. In addition to the lack of transport and storage, many waste collectors still experienced social stigma.  Changes to the Economic Well-being of Collectors    Survey data showed that collectors experienced some economic gains as a result of waste collection work. 63 percent of collectors sampled in R2 believed that their household was economically \u201cbetter off\u201d since they started collecting waste and more households reported that they missed fewer meals since engaging in waste collection. 78 percent of active collectors from R2 reported that the occurrence of missed meals had decreased since working as a Manja Pamodzi collector. These positive findings must be interpreted with some caution, however, as 51% of active collectors from R2 still reported that a member of their household recently missed a meal, and 32% of households believed their household income has remained largely the same since working for Manja Pamodzi. One possible explanation for the contradiction between qualitative and quantitative data is explained when examining the characteristics of those who report changes to their economic well-being. Specifically, of our R2 sample, those who reported being \u201cbetter off\u201d as a result of Manja Pamodzi were also those with much higher amounts of waste sold during the last sale. More productive collectors are likely to see the greatest economic gains given that waste collection is, according to one Manja Pamodzi aggregator, a \u201cbusiness of volume.\u201d   The Processor Experience Under Manja Pamodzi    Since the beginning of Manja Pamodzi in 2015, the number of recycling processing companies involved in the program increased from just four processors in Year 1 (September 2015 to August 2016) to twelve processors by the end of Year 3 (August 2018). According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, there has been a growth not only in the number of processors involved in Manja Pamodzi, but also in Lusaka, broadly. Several factors spurred this growth including: the increased amount of post-consumer packaging waste generated from changes in consumption patterns, advances in technology that make it possible to recycle and process more waste and turn waste into products ready for market, and the lack of existing laws that enforce tax remittance for processing companies (further making recycling potentially quite lucrative because profits are not liable to statutory deductions).  According to Zambian Breweries Plc. staff, the increased number of processors involved in the program not only increased competition between processors-thereby allowing ZB Plc. to negotiate for higher prices of recyclables-but also expanded the types of recyclables that can be processed under the program.   In addition to low quantities of waste received, processors also mentioned numerous logistical challenges associated with Manja Pamodzi. Specifically, several processors complained that deliveries from Manja Pamodzi were irregular and the waste was not always the correct type.   Waste in the Environment    Manja Pamodzi waste collectors collected waste primarily from landfills, local bars, markets, roadside drains, shopping malls, and schools and universities. IGP monthly progress reports show that the largest share of recyclables collected in R1 and R2 under Manja Pamodzi was from the Chunga area in Lusaka, likely owing to the Chunga landfill in this area.   Most respondents believed that Manja Pamodzi led to an overall reduction of waste in their communities and also brought several additional benefits including a reduced risk of cholera and reduced blockage of drains. However, some respondents believed that collectors' emphasis on collecting valuable recyclables led to a reduction of only certain kinds of materials.   AIR cannot accurately assess the extent to which Manja Pamodzi contribution to an overall reduction of waste in these communities and in the city overall because we do not have accurate data on the total amount of recyclable waste generated in the city during this time period. However, data from Zambian Breweries Plc. shows that approximately 3,800 tons of recyclable waste were collected between February 2015 and May 2018. Clear PET, LDPE, and cardboard were the most widely collected materials, while colored PET, HDPE, and cartons were the least collected. This represents a slight shift in the amount of LDPE collected between the first and second rounds of data collection; in R1, LDPE was the third most collected material (below cardboard and clear PET), but has since moved to the second most collected material."

                "text": "Malawi - Power Sector Reform Social Impact was contracted by MCC to develop and conduct an evaluation of the Malawi Compact. Specifically, SI has been tasked to \u201cassess the program design and implementation to develop the most rigorous evaluation design feasible, whether it is a performance or impact evaluation, and identify the most appropriate evaluation methodology feasible given the context.\u201d     Efforts to identify a research design that would allow for a rigorously defined counterfactual were unsuccessful, and as a result this design document outlines plans for a rigorous performance evaluation that will aim to measure key outcome indicators early on in the Compact, midway through, and at the end of the Compact, as well as track changes over time. This evaluation is designed to address the core questions of the evaluation (Table 1) Since the proposed design is a performance evaluation, it is important to note that it may not be possible to state with confidence how the power sector in Malawi has changed (or not changed) as a result of the Compact, as it will not be possible to control for other potential causes of change. In some cases, however, it may be feasible to identify and potentially rule out alternative explanations.    The inability to define a counterfactual requires a reformulation of some of the initial evaluation questions originally proposed by MCC, including some core questions included in the SI-MCC contract. In addition, the Evaluation Assessment Report revealed that both SI and MCC had substantial concerns with regard to the original research questions proposed in Social Impact's contract. This is natural given the way that interventions change over time, and that the proposed questions should be feasible to answer based on the data that can be collected as part of the evaluation. Based on SI's comprehensive desk review, information gathered during the scoping trip, and frequent communication with MCC and MCA-M, the SI evaluation team has developed research questions and research approaches for the PSRP and the IDP project components, as proposed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The original questions and the suggested modifications for each question are presented in the Appendix.   Research Questions    Through a rigorous performance evaluation, the evaluation design aims to answer the following core evaluation questions and several complementary research questions:         What declines in poverty, increases in economic growth, reductions in the electricity related cost of doing business, increases in access to electricity, and increases in value added production are observed over the life of the Compact?         What were the results of the interventions - intended and unintended, positive or negative?         Are there differences in outcomes of interest by gender, age and income? Sex and income disaggregated information for businesses and households will be pursued to the extent possible.         What are the lessons learned and are they applicable to other similar projects?         What is the likelihood that the results of the Project will be sustained over time?         At the household level, the evaluations shall focus on the following program/project/activities impacts on household and individuals: income; expenditures, consumption and access to energy; individual time devoted to leisure and productive activities.          At the enterprise level, the evaluation shall focus on the potential impact of the program/project/activities on: business profitability and productivity; value added production and investment; employment and wage changes; energy consumption and sources of energy used; business losses.          At the regulatory, institutional and policy level, the evaluation shall explore the potential impacts of the program/project/activities on: utility operating costs and losses; financial sustainability; private investment, particularly in generation; expansion of electricity access for customers, particularly the poor.    To answer these questions, the PSRP evaluation design will leverage diverse research methodologies with different timelines for data collection. The evaluation design can be broken into:   \u00b7 PSRP evaluation: The PSRP design incorporates five data collection activities, including: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E Plan and Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses with relevant units, such as billing and procurement, (3) a series of largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4) a proposed survey of Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) employees, and (5) the PSRP process evaluation, focused on implementation and achievement of implementation milestones and outputs will be folded into the PSRP data collection activities.     \u00b7 Enterprise survey: A panel survey of businesses will be used to evaluate both the PSRP and the IDP.   PSRP    Social Impact proposes five data collection activities for the PSRP evaluation: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E Plan and MERA key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses with relevant units, (3) largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4) a survey of current ESCOM employees, and (5) process evaluation. These activities will occur in three phases: at baseline (to be conducted as soon as possible), at midline, and at the end of the Compact. The evaluation will seek to identify changes over time and then consider the extent to which any observed improvements can be attributed to Compact activities."

                "text": "Zambia - Water, Sanitation and Drainage Infrastructure The Zambia Compact is comprised of interventions to the water, sanitation, and drainage infrastructure in the city of Lusaka. The goals of these interventions include reducing poverty through economic development, decreasing the incidence of waterborne and water-related diseases, and generating time savings for businesses and households. To evaluate the impact of the Compact interventions the following evaluation questions were developed by MCC, MCA Zambia, and CDC.  Health    \u00b7   What are the health benefits attributable to each type of Compact activity?  Safe Water Supply/Consumption    \u00b7   What are the current consumption rates of safe versus un-safe water consumption and usage?    \u00b7   Do Compact activities lead to an increase in safe water consumption?  Economic and Social    \u00b7   Do households experience an increase in income due to Compact activities?    \u00b7   Are households able to afford household connections, toilets, and water bills?    \u00b7   Were subsidy provisions adequate for sanitation connections?    \u00b7   What is the probability of finding work for beneficiaries?    \u00b7   What are the time and cost savings/use attributable to each Compact activity?  Flooding    \u00b7   Is there a decrease in the frequency, intensity and duration of flooding?    \u00b7   Is there a decrease in property damage and loss of business caused by flooding?    \u00b7   Is there a decrease in travel time due to reduced flooding?  Given the cause-and-effect nature of the Compact as described in the logic model, CDC recommended an impact evaluation as the most appropriate method to evaluate the effect of the interventions. The impact of interventions to extend water supply and sanitation networks to residential areas will be evaluated by comparing pre and post outcome measures in both intervention and control (counterfactual) areas. Control areas are peri-urban areas that are similar to intervention areas with respect to water and sanitation characteristics, but that are not receiving any interventions.     A suitable control group for the households and businesses that will be affected by the drainage intervention in central Lusaka does not exist. Characteristics that make the Bombay Drain system unique include its mix of commercial and residential development and their propensity to flood due to their co-location along a primary drainage system (the Bombay Drain). The Bombay Drain flows through the major business and commercial districts of Lusaka and this commercial density is not present to the same degree in other drainage systems. The Bombay Drain is also distinguished by its length and the unique nature of its flooding. As a result of these characteristics, we were unable to identify a drainage system in Lusaka with characteristics similar enough to the Bombay Drain to serve as an adequate control area. Therefore, the impact of the drainage intervention on households and businesses will be estimated using pre-post comparisons with no control group.   The primary quantitative study design will be a prospective, cross-sectional intervention-control and pre-post impact evaluation of new water supply and sanitation interventions and drainage improvement interventions. We will evaluate the changes in outcome measures between baseline and post-intervention time periods within the intervention areas and compare these measures to any differences observed in the control areas during the same time period."

The main objective of the survey was to assess the current status of businesses in Lesotho, in relation to four principal factors, namely, water supply and sanitation, essential health services, investment climate in the country, land administration and modernization of the commercial legal system. The survey used a single-stage stratified sampling design in which stratification was done by rural/urban, industrial classification and size of enterprise.   Most enterprises had been in business for slightly less than 10 years and reported that the registration process was lengthy, costly and difficult. The enterprises had more male workers than female workers and had more males as top managers. Most enterprises reported own savings as their first most important source of start- up capital. Majority of enterprises did not know about the credit bureau and did not use financial institutions to secure loans. Generally, enterprises procured their products from local wholesalers and retailers and conducted transactions using cash over the counter as the most common mode of payment to suppliers.With respect to type of land ownership, the largest proportion (37.5%) of individually-owned enterprises was Form C holders, followed by tenant enterprises or those that rented business premises (31.3%). In terms of the acquisition of land/business plots, 43.5% of the enterprises had acquired land/plots through customary allocation by customary chiefs, followed by those that had purchased plots through transfer from someone (22.3%). Most individually-owned enterprises (48.4%) had also acquired plots from customary chiefs, followed by plots that were purchased from someone else (21.3%). In contrast, most jointly-owned enterprises had acquired plots through transfer from someone for cash (32.6%), followed by public sector agency grants (26.3%).  A significant proportion (69.8%) of enterprises did not have formally registered titles/documents to the premises that they used; The top reason for opting to rent/sublease business premises was not intending to acquire land, which was mentioned by 35.1 percent of enterprises. The second reason was of enterprises that did not qualify to hold land in Lesotho, which was mentioned by 23.2 percent of enterprises Majority (67.2 percent) of enterprises did not have occupational insurance. Over 50 percent of the enterprises did not have all the policies. Workers in 83.5 percent of all enterprises did not have access to a health and safety officer.  In 88.3 and 91.7 percent of all enterprises, workers did not have access to a counselor and services of a Social Worker, respectively. Workers in 32.6 percent of all enterprises did not have break hours.  As high as 86.4 percent of the enterprises lost between one (1) and 30 days to sick leave in the last twelve months. Majority of enterprises (84.5%) provided neither educational programmes/activities nor ARVs to their workforce."

                "text": "Establishing baseline conditions to inform adaptive management of South San Francisco Bay salt ponds: A comparison of waterbird abundance from the 1980s to the 2000s The 30,000 acres of wetlands within the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) provide critical habitat for over one million waterbirds annually (Page et al. 1999, Warnock et al. 2002). These wetlands consist largely of tidal marshes and open water ponds. Salt evaporator ponds have been in this landscape for over 150 years (Ver Planck 1958) and are heavily used by shorebirds, waterfowl and other wildlife species (Anderson 1970, Accurso 1992, Takekawa et al. 2001, Warnock et al. 2002). Salt ponds, and former salt ponds now managed as wildlife habitat, provide the majority of the roosting and (for some species) foraging habitat for waterbirds in the San Francisco Bay. The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project (Restoration Project), of which the Refuge and California Department of Fish and Wildlife's (CDFW, also CDFG) Eden Landing Ecological Reserve are a part, is implementing a large-scale plan to convert 15,100 acres of former salt ponds into tidal and managed wetland habitats (SBSPRP 2007).While the restoration of former salt ponds to tidal marsh will increase habitat for species that depend on tidal marshes, it also will reduce the overall pond habitats available for waterbirds. However, through adaptive management, the Restoration Project is committed to maintaining \"baseline\" levels of waterbirds in this site of international importance along the Pacific Flyway (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2013). The Restoration Project has committed to retaining between 10-50% of the 15,100 total Project acres as ponds that are managed largely for waterbirds, but information is needed to ensure that the habitat requirements of large numbers of waterbirds can be met with reduced pond acreage. Monthly ground-based surveys, conducted in former and currently active salt ponds by the U.S. Geological Survey San Francisco Bay Estuary Field Station (USGS) and San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory (SFBBO) have been ongoing since 2002 and 2005, respectively, however, these surveys began after the Restoration Project started. Thus, baseline (i.e., historical) numbers remain largely unknown for many waterbird species prior to the initiation of the Restoration Project. However, in the 1980's, state and federal biologists conducted monthly aerial surveys of waterbirds on all of the salt ponds in the South Bay. These data were recently rediscovered and scanned through a cooperative effort with USGS. In 2009, the USGS scanned these datasheets, and a Refuge intern began the process of entering data into a modified version of SFBBO's current waterbird survey database. In 2010, SFBBO and the Refuge received support from the USFWS Inventory & Monitoring Program, with the goal of completing entry of historical data and analyzing these data to compare historical and current waterbird numbers in Eden Landing Ecological Reserve and the Newark, Alviso, Mowry and Ravenswood salt pond complexes. A metadata report describing the datasets, collection methods, and potential caveats, was submitted previously by SFBBO (Demers & Tokatlian 2012).In this report, we describe the methods we used to compare the current and baseline (historical) datasets and present our findings on the current and historical patterns of abundance and distribution for nine guilds and several individual species of interest to the Refuge, CDFW and Restoration Project. We also compare changes in community structure from the historical to the current data, focusing on changes in patterns of species richness and abundance. We also describe work conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis, to develop a \"conversion factor\" that enabled current (ground-based) survey data to be compared with historical (aerial-based) survey data."

This project identified monitoring metrics that were linked to both management and fundamental objectives and tested each metric to determine which method (rapid vs. intensive) was most effective and efficient.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 5 is implementing the Salt Marsh Integrity Monitoring Protocol (Neckles et al. 2013) to assess and track the condition of salt marsh habitats on USFWS Refuges with salt marsh habitats. To assist in the development of analytical tools using data from this long-term monitoring program we will identify priority analyses for refuge specific monitoring data. The initial analysis tool to be developed by this project is focused on the surface elevation table (SET) data collected by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and other partnering institutions. We will develop analytical tools to facilitate the current and future analysis of SET data collected within long-term ecological monitoring studies."

A bi-monthly census of salinities and bird numbers was taken to determine if there was a correlation between the bird use and salinity of salt evaporation ponds near East Palo Alto. The study was conducted on four salt evaporation ponds in San Mateo County, from June 1978 through June 1979. Salinity readings were taken from each pond, and the total number of birds per pond was counted. The salinities ranged from a low of 50 parts/1,000 in Pond I to a high of 270 parts/1,000 in Pond IV. Thirty-six species were identified and a total of 49,857 birds were counted. Shorebirds, waterfowl, and gulls were the most common species using the salt ponds.  The surface-feeding ducks and the phalaropes exhibited a preference for Pond I which had the lowest average salinity reading of the four ponds studies. The shorebirds, diving ducks, and gulls all showed a high degree of salinity tolerance and were found on all ponds. The shorebirds made the heaviest use of ponds which were sufficiently shallow for wading regardless of salinities, thus showing a possible food foraging preference."

Historically, Bair Island was part of a large complex of tidal marshes and mud flats within the drainage of Bay and Belmont Sloughs (PWA 2000). Bair Island was diked in the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s for agricultural practices including cattle grazing. The island was converted to salt evaporation ponds by Leslie Salt Company starting in 1946, and remained  in salt production until 1965. The lands were drained and eventually sold to a series of real estate development companies. This site is a large, restorable complex of former salt evaporators, and has been a major priority for addition to the Refuge since the original boundaries were drawn. The restoration of tidal  habitats at Bair Island is ecologically important to South San Francisco Bay. Following restoration, Bair Island will become an integral part of the extensive wetland complex within the Refuge and adjacent state and privately owned wetlands. In addition to restoring 1400 acres of tidal wetlands to the much depleted South San Francisco Bay (SFB) tidal-marsh complex, the restoration activities planned for Bair Island provide a unique opportunity for documenting the effects and chronology of events that evolve during the implementation of a tidal salt-marsh restoration. Although similar restoration projects have  occurred within the SFB (Cooley Landing, Warm Springs), project development has not been documented to the extent that a specific set of guidelines could be produced for use during subsequent restoration projects. Therefore, the restoration plan, while primarily describing the steps required to produce a successful salt-marsh restoration, also provides a monitoring plan and  the testing of hypotheses. These efforts will track the development of the tidal marsh as well as providing valuable information for future restoration projects."

By March 1996, the herd had grown from 16 animals to approximately 255. A number of unresolved bison management issues, some of which were controversial, led to the development of this Jackson Bison Herd Management Plan and Environmental Assessment by Grand Teton National Park (National Park Service) and the National Elk Refuge (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) in cooperation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and the Bridger-Teton National Forest (U.S. Forest Service). Since 1987, when a draft environmental assessment and management plan for the Jackson bison herd (JBH) was released but not adopted, the level of monitoring of the herd has increased and several studies of the herd's biology and ecology have been completed. That biological information, the results of two public scoping efforts in 198 7 and 1991, and the agencies' concerns and responsibilities were integrated to form the goals and objectives of the draft Jackson Bison Herd Management Plan and Environmental Assessment released in November 1994. Public response to that draft Plan (see Appendix IV) and additional biological information provided the basis for changes that have been incorporated into this final Management Plan and Environmental Assessment. The plan's overall management goal is to maintain a free-rangipg bison herd in Jackson Hole, as free from human intervention as practically possible. The management objectives are: 1. to maintain a self-sustaining population, 2. to minimize the potential for transmission of brucellosis (with which some bison are infected) among bison, elk, and domestic livestock, 3. to reduce the dependency of bison on supplemental feed to the extent practical, 4. to maintain recreational opportunities associated with a free-ranging bison herd, and 5. to minimize the potential for bison-human conflicts and property damage caused by bison."

The location of these marshes within protected embayments and the absence of large rivers on Cape Cod result in minimal sediment supply and a dominance of organic matter contribution to sediment peat. Age models based on 210-lead and 137-cesium were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed over the past century. The continuous rate of supply age model was used to age date 11 cores (10 low marsh and 1 high marsh) across four salt marshes. Both vertical accretion rates and carbon burial increased from 1900 to the years of collection, 2013 and 2014. Elevation of the marsh surface was measured to evaluate where the marsh falls within the current tidal frame. The historic marsh surface elevation was then reconstructed from the calculated age of each depth interval and its elevation, assuming that elevations within this shallow zone (less than 30 centimeters) have been preserved for the past century."

Major agricultural pollutants include bacterial pathogens and nutrients that originate from animal wastes. Several concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are located in close proximity to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma; it is our understanding that these facilities are not US EPA registered. The goal of this study was to survey refuge surface water and sediment for known bacterial pathogens of wildlife, especially waterfowl, which may have originated from CAFO wastes. Sampling was conducted during the spring, summer, and fall of 2001 and 2002 at ten sites located on watersheds downstream of agricultural sites. Bacterial indicators of fecal contamination (fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci) were identified and counted in surface water samples. Fecal coliform levels exceeded US EPA human recreational bathing water limits in 22 of 50 samples, and fecal streptococcus numbers exceeded human recreational bathing limits in 47 of 50 samples. Antibiotic resistance profiles were determined for a subset of fecal colifom and fecal streptococcus isolates. The tested isolates were frequently resistant to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, and tetracycline, antibiotics commonly administered to livestock. In addition, surface water and sediment samples were analyzed for the presence of bacteria (Clostridium botulinum type C, toxigenic Escherichia coli, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella spp., and Yersinia spp) with pathogenic potential to wild and domestic animals. Of the organisms surveyed, salmonellae and escherichiae were isolated. The data presented herein will provide a benchmark for future studies investigating the potential long term environmental effects of agricultural practices on the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge."

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).    Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Causes of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

Following European settlement, the distribution of these forests were greatly reduced due to past timber harvesting, agricultural conversion, and fire-suppression practices. Consequently, these forest ecosystems are of great conservation priority and in need of restoration. Before we can develop restoration strategies for these ecosystems, more detailed information on their successional dynamics is needed, including a better understanding of how past timber harvesting has influenced forest ecosystem development. In particular, an understanding of how forest ecosystems respond to a frequent surface fire-return interval is needed. We examined age structure and radial growth patterns, and related these patterns to known fires in old-growth mixed-pine stands in the Seney Wilderness Area, an area with old-growth mixed-pine forests. These results suggest that natural fire appears to effect radial growth of surviving trees negatively for several years following the fire, but also allows for some individuals to show increased growth as well as promoting the establishment of pine seedlings."

Hunters from 13 villages killed polar bears during this period. The documented minimum polar bear harvest for 1980/81 and 1981/82 hunting seasons were 106 and 90, respectively. A minimum of 21 bears were harvested from January 1 to July 30, 1980 (ADF&G records) and have been included in the pooled sample of 217 killed bears. Of this total, 134 (61.8%) were bears for which complete sex and age information was obtained; 52 (23.9%) were bears for which adequate sex and/or age class information was obtained; and 31 (14.3%) were bears known to have been killed for which sex and age information was unknown. The sample of 134 known sex and age bears consisted of 27 percent litter members (cubs, yearlings, or 2-year olds), 31 percent females greater than 3 years of age, and 42 percent males greater than 3 years of age. The sex ratio was 81 (60.4%) males to 53 (39.6%) females. The sex ratio of bears captured from 1967-76 in a tagging study (Lentfer, 1977) was significantly different. The mean age of males and females was 7.3! 4.8 years. Male mean age was 5.8 \u00b1 3.9 years and female was 9.0 \u00b1 5.4 years. A significant inverse relationship was determined for harvested female cubs less than 3 years, female subadults, 4-5 years, and females age 6-10. A significant positive relationship was determined for harvested females 10 years or older, subadult males, and adult males 6 years or older. From January 1980 to April 1982 an average annual removal of 38 females occurred. This figure excluded 31 unknown sex and age bears. If the percentage of adult females of known sex and age bears is applied to the 31 excluded bears then the average annual female removal was 44 bears. Polar bears were harvested during each month of the year except September. Of 197 bears sampled, 123 (62.4%) were harvested during November, December, and January. Forty-five bears (22.8%) were harvested in October and November, primarily in the North Slope villages. Recent harvest chronology differs markedly from that of the sports hunting era when most bears were taken from February through April. Of the 124 hunters who killed 217 polar bear during 1980-82, 37 (29.8%) killed more than one bear; of these, 27 (73.8%) killed more than 2 bears. Snowmachines (89.5%) were the most common hunting transportation form used, small boats (6.8%) ranked second and other means accounted for the remainder of the harvest."

Our initial interest was in whether water salinity was involved. We researched the effects of saline drinking water by conducting an experiment on captive wild-strain goslings that were collected as eggs from Cutler marsh in Cache County, Utah and by observing free-ranging broods in the brood-rearing impoundments. Mortality occurred in captive goslings at 18 uS/cm; effects on growth were evident at 12 uS/cm. We identified 12 hydrologically distinct areas within the 9 impoundments at the refuge. From 15 April to 15 July, conductivity measurements ranged from 3.1 to 25.4,uS/cm within these areas. Our results suggest that at the levels that goslings experienced during the critical hatchling period during 1996 & 1997, salinity was not a serious problem. During exceptionally dry years, if salinity levels rise during early spring, then its effects might be more directly related to gosling mortality. At the levels we measured during this study, mortality in free-ranging goslings was independent of specific conductivity. Rather, annual goose production appeared to be limited by predation and human disturbance. This conclusion is supported by 2 lines of evidence: a) low ground-nest success, and b) low gosling survival. Ground nests had lower nest success (56%-9 of 16 nests) in both years than artificial nesting platforms (90%-9 of 10 nests). Gosling survival to fledging was 25% and 52% in 1996 and 1997, respectively, well below survivorships levels reported in the literature. Our observations suggest that coyotes are abundant on the refuge and we observed them hunting for geese. Human disturbance appears to predispose goslings to mortality because goslings often became separated from their parents after disturbance. Low productivity also is related to the low number of breeding pairs on the refuge. During the summers 1996 and 1997, number of nesting pairs of geese averaged 26 and 39, respectively."

The City of Davis, California (City), a community 15 miles west of Sacramento, routinely disposes of treated sewage water by irrigating upland fields.  The treated sewage water contains a slightly elevated concentration of selenium (approximately 4 ug/L).  To maximize evaporative transpiration of the applied sewage water, the fields are periodically mowed to promote new growth.  The fields have consistently attracted large numbers of nesting mallards, and as a conservation measure City personnel search for duck nests before they mow a field.  They salvage the eggs from all nests found and turn them over to the North Delta Conservancy where the eggs are artificially incubated, and the hatched ducklings are raised until they are old enough to be re-introduced into the wild.  Because the water has slightly elevated selenium levels, the duck eggs contain slightly elevated selenium levels as well.  Past monitoring of mallard eggs conducted by the City of Davis (Mike Conners, City of Davis, pers. comm.) has revealed egg selenium concentrations as high as about 20 \u00b5g/g (dwb) and as low as normal background of about 1-3 \u00b5g/g (Skorupa and Ohlendorf, 1991). This range of exposure is ideal for a large sample size determination of the critical threshold point for toxicity.  Typically the City of Davis sends anywhere from 300 to 800 mallard eggs per nesting season to the North Delta Conservancy.  This report summarizes the methods and data generated by an investigation designed to provide statistical resolution of the selenium toxicity threshold point for mallard eggs with enough precision to distinguish between two alternative interpretations of laboratory toxicity testing results: (1) a lower threshold estimated by Service of 6-10 \u00b5g/g (dwb) versus (2) a higher threshold of 16-20 \u00b5g/g estimated by the Regulated Community."

Together they comprise the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area (SWMA). The weather in 1981 was average or above, but precipitation continued well below average since the fall of 1980. The 30 year old trapping plan was replaced with a new Fur Management Plan. The 20 year old grazing plan was amended with the production of a Grasslands Management Plan/Proposal for the North Marsh Unit. For the second year in a row, the Aquatic Vegetation Survey was performed as practiced prior to 1975. There had been a tremendous response by aquatic vegetation to increased water in 1979 and 1980. Grazing practices were better monitored and controlled resulting in healthier habitat. 1981, however was one of the poorest water and weather years in recent history and cattle suffered.  Wildlife diversity was quite good. Many ponds were drying up so shorebirds were quite abundant. Despite abundant water in 1980 and \u201cenough\u201d in 1981, waterfowl use was not as much as expected.  After fighting to provide habitat, we find ourselves with not enough ducks still alive in flyway to utilize what habitat we have. The Refuge portion of the SWMA is closed to hunting."

                "text": "Progress report 1987: predator control to enhance the production of Greater Sandhill Cranes on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge The nesting population of greater sandhill cranes on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon has declined from 236 pairs in 1971 to 181 pairs in 1986. Nesting  studies conducted from 1966 to 1987 have repeatedly demonstrated that the primary limiting factor for cranes nesting on Malheur Refuge is the predation of eggs by ravens, raccoons, and coyotes, and the predations on prefledged chicks by coyotes. On 21 January 1986, Malheur Refuge staff assisted by U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) employees began controlling predators on approximately 27,000 acres (14%) of Malheur Refuge. Recruitment of crane chicks in the predator control area (14.9%) was the highest ever recorded on the refuge. Because of the highly successful results recorded in 1986, the predator control area was expanded in 1987 to include approximately 46% (85,000 acres) of the refuge.  In 1987, 460 coyotes were removed by the following methods: aerial gunning(80%), calling and shooting (8%), trapping and snares (7%), and denning (6%).  An estimated 124 ravens were removed using 124 dozen chicken eggs injected with DRC-1339 and an additional 13 ravens were shot. Sixteen raccoons were taken by the following methods: snare 3, shooting 3, live trap 3, and leg hold trap 7. Overall crane production was 43 chicks, less than the 50 recorded last year but above the average annual production of 31. Recruitment was 10.6%, significantly higher than average (6.6%) but less than the record of 14.9% recorded in last year's predator control area. Additional nesting studies of ducks showed a similar pattern i.e., nesting success was well above long term averages but below the high levels recorded last year. The one notable exception was Canada geese which had the highest nesting success ever recorded on the refuge. The primary factors believed responsible for the diminished results in 1987 were: 1) much drier conditions in 1987 which reduced nesting habitat for cranes and attracted more coyotes to the refuge from adjacent arid areas, 2) slightly higher coyote populations county-wide, 3) less intense predator control efforts per acre in 1987 versus 1986, and 4) cool, wet weather in June that most likely increased chick mortality. The objectives of the 1987 effort were to have a nesting success of 75%, fledging success 25%, and recruitment 15%. The actual outcome was 57%, 17.1%, and 10.6% respectively. All of these outcomes were well above long-term averages but below objective levels. Based on these results, the 1987 season was judged a limited success. In comparing 1987 results with long term averages for nesting success and chick mortality the data suggests that a minimum of 17-18 chicks (same as last year) reached flight stage that would not have survived without predator control this year. It is recommended that control efforts for 1988 be held the same as 1987 with an increased effort to be given to all control efforts, particularly during April-flay."

Pond occupancy by duck pairs averaged 37% during mid-May counts and 48% for late May and early June counts. A positive linear relation occurred between the estimated number of duck pairs and the percent of basins with water during 1-15 May.  There were 3,339 duck nests found in grassland habitats from 1966 through 1981. Approximately 66% (85% Mayfield)    of these were depredated or abandoned. Mammals caused 88% of nest failures. Half or more of the eventually    successful clutches were unhatched by 10 July in 9 of 16 years. Haying would have disturbed or destroyed an average of 43%, 33%, 22%, 15%, and 9% of the duck nests if initiated on 10 July, 15 July, 20 July, 25 July, and 1 August,    respectively.  The total average size of completed clutch for all species was 29% smaller at the end of the nesting season than at the beginning, underscoring the importance of protecting early clutches.  Production averaged 30 broods per 100 pairs of ducks and ranged from 15 to 61 broods per 100 pairs. Brood densities    ranged from 10 to 63/km2 and averaged 12/km2. Mean brood size averaged 6.4 for all species. July broods averaged 7.2 ducklings and August broods 5.7 ducklings. Duckling loss averaged 2.6 per brood and 85% (2.2 ducklings) of this loss was estimated to occur during the first 14 days after hatch.  Wetlands of all sizes and classes were important at ome time to one species of duck or another. With the exception of    some diving ducks, all species used a complex of sizes and classes of wetlands for space, food, and shelter necessary for nesting and brooding. Pair counts during 20 May-7 June were most indicative of the breeding population. A    combination of two brood counts resulted in the best estimate of annual production. An average of only 50% of the total duck broods per year was counted during the 1-15 July surveys, which approximated the average time of the Service's July aerial surveys. During this study the area produced in average of 1 duck per 4 ha of upland and had a nest density of approximately 1 nest per 14 ha. Nest success rates averaged 36.1% (16.3% Mayfield). Predation was significantly reduced by good vegetative cover at nest sites. Seeded grasslands (dense nesting cover) yielded better production than native prairie or croplands. Seeded grasslands also produced 3 times more ducklings per unit area than adjacent native prairie and more than 14 times as many as adjacent, annually tilled croplands.  Ducks generally showed higher neat densities and better nesting success when using growing grain crops than when nesting in standing or mulched stubble fields. Among native mixed-grass; prairie and seeded grassland, production was enhanced by leaving fields idle or by treating them with periodic burning. Duck production was generally lowered by grazing fields of native prairie but duck production on grazing lands was higher than in annually tilled croplands.

All surveys were implemented by staff of the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia Beach, Virginia, throughout the sea turtle nesting season. Two seasonal, full-time biological technicians were hired to search twenty-five miles of beach along the northern periphery of the nesting range of the Atlantic loggerhead. Refuge biologists investigated two loggerhead sea turtle crawls during the 2001 nesting season. The first successful nesting for the 2001 nesting season occurred on Back Bay NWR, 0.2 miles south of Little Island City Park, on the North Mile. This first nest consisted of 127 eggs. A second crawl was detected on False Cape State Park, seven miles south of the Back Bay NWR beach access ramp. It yielded a nest of 115 eggs. This nest and the female loggerhead were located by Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) personnel on July 2, 2001, during a night patrol. They captured the nesting adult female and applied a flipper tag and satellite transmitter. No nests or crawls were located along the oceanfront of Sandbridge, the Virginia Beach Resort Area, or Fort Story during 2001. Night patrols were conducted from June 15 to August 15 by VIMS personnel. Only one loggerhead sea turtle was captured this year.  Five attached appendices also include: 1) Year 2001 Sea Turtle Strandings, 2) Year 2001 Sea Turtle Nest Relocations, 3) A Marine Science Museum Hatchling Report for 2000-2001, 4) Article on the Release of VMSM Year-Old Hatchlings 5) A 2001 Summary of Costs Associated with this program."

                "text": "Coyote Willow Mowing Project : Biological Summary Report The primary goal of the project is to enhance/promote the establishment, growth, spread, and survival of willow species (primarily coyote willow). Many stands/patches of willow habitat on Alamosa NWR have died over the past 14 years. Refuge biologists suspect that changes in hydrologic conditions (i.e., drought, altered hydro-periods and volume of flows in the Rio Grande, and reduced groundwater levels) are the primary causes. Additionally, coyote willow, which is the dominant species in these locations, is a relatively short lived species and many of these stands are old and have simply died. As a result, there are many decadent stands/patches of willow throughout the riparian corridor. Like many vegetation species, when a build-up of decadent vegetation occurs, it restricts the establishment, growth, spread, and overall vigor of young plants. Refuge biologists suspect that the dead willow in these stands are restricting the growth of young plants due to competition for space and light as well as other factors.  Refuge staff decided to mow (using a skid steer with an attached hydro-axe) portions of the riparian habitat with the expectation that this will provide a \u201crelease\u201d for existing small plants and will encourage the establishment and spread of new plants. Evidence suggests that mowing and prescribed burning conducted during the appropriate times (e.g., non-growing season) can improve riparian willow habitat conditions (Rea and Gillingham 2007). All mowing activities took place outside the breeding season for Southwestern Willow Flycatchers and Yellow-billed Cuckoo.  This report summarizes the results of this willow mowing project."

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project.   GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress WST.  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently.   GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.   This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size.   A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.   The GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the \"final\" GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.  There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 2c, Combined data, \"Set1\"   The \"individual\" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:          GSSTF_Fxx_2c, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)    The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_2c collection.

Radio-transmitters were attached to a total of 113 different bears during this time period and these bears were monitored through denning (October - November) each year. More males were captured in age classes 5.5 years of age or less, while females were more abundant in age classes 6.5 years old and older. No natural mortalities occurred among sample bears in 1982, however, 10 apparent mortalities occurred among 17 young bears (cubs and yearlings) in 1983. In 1984, 13 of 24 young bears were apparent mortalities, and in 1985, 18 of 40 young bears were apparent mortalities. Reasons for these high mortality rates in 1983 (58.9%), 1984 (54.2%), and 1985 (45.0%) among young bears is unknown. Four mortalities were recorded during 1985. An adult female (19.5-year old) and an adult male (20.5-year old) died over winter of exposure and drowning, repectively. Two bears ( a 13.5-year old female and a 3.5-year old male) were shot by hunters. Brown bears were observed feeding on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) carcasses (adults and calves) on 6 occasions in 1982, on 15 occasions in 1983, on 20 occasions in 1984, and on 31 occasions in 1985. Preliminary analysis of radio-relocation data indicate that brown bears appear to shift habitat use patterns to coastal areas in June and early July to coincide with occupancy of those habitats by calving and post-calving caribou. Emerged from winter dens occurred in late occurred in late April and throughout May in 1983 and 1985, but was confined to late April through mid-May in 1984, with early emergence of males and non-parturient females and later emergence of females with cubs of the year. Elevations of den sites averaged 816 \u00b1 6lm(SE) in 1983, 966 \u00b1 46m(SE) in 1984, and 964 \u00b1 64m(SE) in 1985. Aspects of den sites were predominantly southeast facing slopes (mean aspect, 1983 = 145\u00b0\u00b120\u00b0SE; 1984 = 150\u00b0\u00b1l8\u00b0SE; 1985 = 146\u00b0++ l8\u00b0SE). Slope of den sites averaged 54\u00b1 4%SE in 1983, 56\u00b1 2%SE in 1984, and 58\u00b1 3%SE in 1985. In October and November, bears moved south into foothill and mountainous habitats to den.

Attention: These data are not appropriate for estimates of percentage cover. NPP-associated percent cover measurements were developed for and are used solely to provide the best estimate of biomass production. Becuase the methodology results in measurements of overlapping subcanopy systems and canopies of adjacent individuals, NPP percent cover measurements are not an appropriate measure of actual aerial plant cover. Doing so will result in inflated numbers for the \"actual\" vegetative cover. Attention: Data through 2003 was replaced online per below on 9/22/2011. Analyses and results for ANPP differ from previous uses of the data from 1989-1998 (Huenneke et al., 2002) in three ways: (1) Yucca elata was removed prior to analysis because its growth form results in large errors in biomass estimates from year-to-year, (2) regressions between biomass and plant volume used an intercept equal to 0 to be consistent with a recent study in a similar system (Muldavin et al., 2008), and (3) reference harvests obtained in extreme years resulted in adjusted regression coefficents through time that reflect year-to-year variation in ANPP. These changes result in ANPP values that are smaller compared (Peters et al. submitted) with previous studies (Huenneke et al., 2002)."

                "text": "Evaluation of the 100 meter protective zone for bald eagle nests in southeast Alaska Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests in southeast Alaska have been protected by a 100 m buffer zone since 1968. Nests near logging developments were surveyed before and after logging had occurred. The average length of time between cessation of logging and the nest resurvey was 5 years. After logging had ceased, nest activity rates were not reduced compared to unlogged areas. The probability of nest destruction by wind was significantly increased when clear-cut logging was within 45 m of the nest tree. Blowdown timber was found adjacent to 42% of the clear-cut areas in the vicinity of eagle nests. If blowdown associated with logging had occurred within the 100 m protective buffer zone, an average 30% of the zone contained blowdown. The 100 m nest buffer zones may be inadequate for providing nesting and perching habitat, indefinitely, in the face of adjacent sustained yield clear-cut logging practices. Management of the entire coastal beach fringe forest in old growth status is recommended."

                "text": "Wolves of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Their seasonal movements and prey relationships Twenty six wolves were captured and radio collared in 1984 and 1985 on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These wolves included members of 8 packs and 11 lone wolves. Average weights were 43.1 kg for males and 36.7 kg for females with the average age being 2-3 years old. Only 5 wolves were 4 years old and older. Activity areas were delinieated for all packs as some packs had insufficient data to accurately define territories. These activity areas were non-overlaping. Only 1 wolf pack had a large scale seasonal shift in areas used. Formation of new packs and long-distance movements were common. One wolf had a documented movement of 770 km, the longest recorded movement in Alaksa. Wolf densities were 1/726 km2 in 1984 and 1/686 km2 in 1985 for an area of 24,700 km2. Litter sizes averaged 3.0 and 4.2-4.75 in 1984 and 1985 respectively. Over-summer pup survival was related to pack size; more pups survived in larger packs. This was in contrast to other studies where pup survival and pack size were unrelated. After wolves had left, den sites were visited, scats were collected, and dens were mapped. Mortality (natural and human induced) was 35% of the fall population. Rabies was documented in the wolf population in the spring on 1985. It is believed that rabies in the wolf population in the arctic is more common than previously thought and may be cyclic in conjunction with outbreaks of rabies in the Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) population."

The captive-reared birds consisted of 52 one-year old geese raised at the refuge propagation center on Amchitka, and 19 one-year old, 17 two-year old, 18 three-year old, 8 four-year old and 3 five-year old geese raised at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center at Laurel, Maryland. Within this total, nine pairs were present: 17 captive reared adults and one wild bird that had been present at Amchitka since 1976. These pairs had been culled from the Amchitka breeding flock in the hope that they would be successful breeders under wild conditions."
