TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.                  TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:  In fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.                  TSASC:  TSASC Inc.

There are certain exceptions to this detailed in the Government Code. The code is available here: http://bit.ly/CAinventory  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset changes infrequently and is uploaded manually as needed by DataSF staff  <strong>D.

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.  <strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> In compliance with CA Government Code 6270.5 (passed via SB 272), the City must publish a catalog of enterprise systems that collect data about the public. There are certain exceptions to this detailed in the Government Code. The code is available here: http://bit.ly/CAinventory  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset changes infrequently and is uploaded manually as needed by DataSF staff  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Companion dataset inventory dataset</em> A companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Dataset-inventory/y8fp-fbf5\">dataset of inventoried and published datasets can be accessed online</a> as well.. demographics;environment;ref:inventory;sb272;sb 272;gov code 6270.5;systems;open data;inventory.

In order to help contractors and private residents avoid existing utility lines (including gas, electrical, and water lines) when digging, the Chicago Department of Transportation maintains 811 Chicago, a free, 24-hour service to private contractors and homeowners in Chicago. Anyone planning to dig within Chicago must obtain a \u201cdig ticket\u201d from 811 Chicago. 811 Chicago notifies all utilities of the impending excavations. The utility owners then send out staff to mark the location of the underground facilities within 48 hours (excluding emergencies), not counting Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.<br><br>    The dataset on which this filtered view is based shows these utility notifications. Since it is common for the same dig ticket to produce multiple notifications, the same dig ticket will appear multiple times and the dataset cannot be used without further refinement to count, map, or analyze unique excavations in Chicago.<br><br>    This filtered view shows only the most recent notification for each utility. It, therefore, removes some of the duplication in the dataset but still will produce multiple records per dig ticket if multiple utilities have been notified.<br><br>    See https://ipi.cityofchicago.org/Digger for more information on the dig ticket system.. infrastructure;economy;transportation;excavation;utilities;transportation;dig ticket.

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

                "text": "Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles. Alternative Fuels Data Center - Overview of tail pipe emissions from hybrid vehicles nationally, by state    __Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles__    Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do. When measuring well-to-wheel emissions, the electricity source is important: for PHEVs and EVs, part or all of the power provided by the battery comes from off-board sources of electricity. There are emissions associated with the majority of electricity production in the United States.    __Electricity Sources and Emissions__    EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have a well-to-wheel emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional fossil fuels for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a well-to-wheel emissions benefit.    __Direct and Well-to-Wheel Emissions__    Vehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a direct basis and a well-to-wheel basis.    Direct emissions are emitted through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. EVs produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. And when using the internal combustion engine, PHEVs also produce tailpipe emissions. However, their direct emissions are typically lower than those of comparable conventional vehicles.    Well-to-wheel emissions include all emissions related to fuel production, processing, distribution, and use. In the case of gasoline, emissions are produced while extracting petroleum from the earth, refining it, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning it in vehicles. In the case of electricity, most electric power plants produce emissions, and there are additional emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and distribution of the primary energy sources they use for electricity production.

This demonstrated that animals pre-vaccinated with either MP-122 or the deletion variant MP-121-NSm-del exhibited an enhanced response indicative of priming for the response by the initial vaccination.  Access data in file Antibody_results_intramuscular.xlsx    The overall purpose of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Rift Valley Fever Control in Agriculture is to increase the food supply by developing and applying a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever disease among livestock in Africa.  Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that continues to have a devastating impact on human and animal health in Africa.  Since the discovery of RVF as the cause of an outbreak among sheep and humans during the early 1930s in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the disease has emerged as one of the most important zoonoses in Africa. The disease has and continues to affect the health of thousands to millions of humans and animals, and the livestock industry has lost millions of dollars, and therefore, affecting hundreds of millions of those whose livelihood depends on livestock, exaggerating poverty on already deprived communities.    The specific aim of the Lab is to conduct a 5 year research project to develop and evaluate a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever (RVF) among livestock in Tanzania and other RVF virus enzootic African regions and thereby improve food security, nutrition and livelihoods in Africa as a USAID priority under Feed the Future, the U.S. Government\u2019s global hunger and food security initiative.

Prior to the TSAs, the magnitude of transportation services had long been underestimated, as most national measures counted only the value of for-hire services. Measurement of services provided only by for-hire firms misses the sizable contribution of transportation services that take place within nontransportation industries, termed as in-house transportation.    To more accurately measure transportation services, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, jointly developed the Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs). The TSAs, as a supplement to the U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, measure the contribution of both for-hire and in-house transportation.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend. The University of Colorado's Sea Level Research Group compares global sea level rates calculated by different research organizations and provides detailed explanations about the issues involved.. sea level;sea level changes;tide gauges;. ."

This broad and novel database of 52 countries over 2001\u201311, allowed a study that assesses the link between financial intermediation and saving. The study finds that the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region lags well behind other regions in terms of financial depth, as measured by gross private domestic financial assets. LAC countries also have a larger share of bank deposits and cash in the private sector portfolio, compared to non-bank assets (bonds and shares). Moreover, within the institutional investor industry, pension funds are relatively developed in the region, although they grew out of the compulsory pension systems in several countries that date back to the 1980s and 1990s. The findings also indicate that LAC countries have about 40 percent of gross private financial wealth invested abroad, but just 4 percent of gross private liabilities have that origin, which attests to region\u2019s obstacles in tapping international markets. The countries in general present a small share of household and business saving being intermediated through the financial system. In the specific case of bank deposits, just 5 percent of household saving and 3 percent of business saving are kept in the banking system.<br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/idb/dataset/vsdz-m8v5</b></br></br>. housing & development;financial intermediaries; banking system; capital markets; institutional investors; household saving; corporate saving.

Note:  Please use this link to leave the data view and to see the full description: https://data.ct.gov/Environment-and-Natural-Resources/Spill-Incidents/wr2a-rnsg  Description of Dataset: From CT DEEP Spill Incident Tracking System (SITS) Database [July 1996 \u2013 present]:  This data set represents information reported to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP), generally to the CT DEEP Dispatch Center, regarding releases of substances to the environment, generally through accidental spills.  Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.  Examples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected.   Data limitations and factors to consider when using this data:  This data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.  This dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center.   For a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  List Rents (EC9)    FULL MEASURE NAME  List Rents    LAST UPDATED  October 2016    DESCRIPTION  List rent refers to the advertised rents for available rental housing and serves as a measure of housing costs for new households moving into a neighborhood, city, county or region.       DATA SOURCE  real Answers  (1994 \u2013 2015)  no link    Zillow  Metro Median Listing Price All Homes (2010-2016)  http://www.zillow.com/research/data/    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  List rents data reflects median rent prices advertised for available apartments rather than median rent payments; more information is available in the indicator definition above. Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section.     Individual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.    Due to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.    Inflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.. finance;health;infrastructure;vital signs.

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, actin cytoskeleton, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed.

The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.  Workers\u2019 compensation indemnity benefits are cash benefits paid to injured workers. These benefits include benefits for temporary disability (time loss), permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, and death. Statute sets eligibility criteria and the rates at which insurers pay these benefits. In the case of death from work-related causes, indemnity benefits are paid to survivors. Indemnity benefits also include vocational assistance benefits paid on behalf of severely disabled workers to get them back to work.  Indemnity benefits also include settlements between workers and insurers. Claim disposition agreements (CDAs) and disputed claim settlements (DCSs) are the two forms of settlements.  The Workers' Benefit Fund ( WBF)provides funds for programs that assist employers and injured workers. Assessment revenues, not insurance premiums, finance these programs. Employers and workers each pay half the assessment. The two major programs are the Retroactive Program and the Re-employment Assistance Program.  The Retroactive Program pays cost-of-living increases to workers or their beneficiaries based on changes in average wages. The two major benefits paid are for permanent total disability and death. Since at least 1995, the majority of PTD and death benefits have been paid from this program.  The Re-employment Assistance Program provides incentives for injured workers to return to work, through the Employer-at-Injury Program (EAIP) and the Preferred Worker Program (PWP). Benefits common to both are wage subsidies, worksite modifications, and employment purchases.  Workers who have not been released to regular work but can return to transitional jobs are eligible for the EAIP. Use of this program allows many claims to remain nondisabling even though the workers have medical restrictions.  Workers who have a permanent disability and are unable to return to regular work are eligible for the PWP benefits, which may be initiated by either the worker or the employer. In addition, claim cost reimbursement is paid for preferred workers who suffer new injuries.  The data in this table include estimated figures and are subject to revision.

The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year.  The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous.  For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.  (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

In particular, we chose 128 articles containing at least one NE. Compared to the News-100 corpus the documents of Reuters-128 are significantly shorter and thus carry a smaller context.    To create the annotation of NEs with URIs, we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First, FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al., 2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards, the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore, the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially, but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases. While annotating, we left out ticker symbols of companies (e.g., GOOG for Google Inc.), abbreviations and job descriptions be-  cause those are always preceded by the full company name respectively a person\u2019s name.. corpus;evaluation;linguistic;linguistics;lod;ner;nif;rdf;training;.

This MISTI survey data file contains the combined response data from five semi-annual iterations of surveys conducted from September 2012 through November 2014 to determine whether USAID project activities caused changes in stability and resilience at the district and village levels. For the five waves of surveys, each of which was conducted over several months, a total of 190,264 individual interviews were undertaken in 5,093 different villages across 130 districts of the 23 provinces where stabilization initiatives were being implemented or considered. These data were compiled into one file to facilitate easy access for international development practitioners, researchers and other interested parties in accordance with the USAID's Open Data Policy. As part of this process, village names and locations have been replaced with unique village identifiers to ensure the safety of Afghan stakeholders. This preserves a researcher's ability to access granular data and see trends at the village-level, but prevents data consumers from attributing responses to a named Afghan village. The datasets supplied here are in CSV format. These data were analyzed for the MISTI impact evaluation of USAID stabilization programming in Afghanistan, 2012-2014. USAID/Afghanistan's MISTI ranks as the largest and most comprehensive trends analysis and impact evaluation of stabilization interventions that the U.S. Government has ever undertaken.

This filtered view presents Real Gross Domestic Product for the educational services sector in the State of Iowa by year beginning in 1997.    Gross domestic product (GDP) is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within Iowa in a particular period of time. In concept, an industry's GDP by state, referred to as its \"value added\", is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus its intermediate inputs (consumption of goods and services purchased from other U.S. industries or imported). The Iowa GDP a state counterpart to the Nation's GDP, the Bureau's featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. Iowa GDP differs from national GDP for the following reasons: Iowa GDP excludes and national GDP includes the compensation of federal civilian and military personnel stationed abroad and government consumption of fixed capital for military structures located abroad and for military equipment, except office equipment; and Iowa GDP and national GDP have different revision schedules. GDP is reported in millions of current dollars.    Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure of Iowa's gross product that is based on national prices for the goods and services produced within Iowa. The real estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are measured in millions of chained dollars, but have been multiplied by 1,000,000 to display in dollars for visualization purposes.

A \"Y\" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.<br /><br />Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.<br /><br />The \u201cMorphine (Not Heroin)\u201d values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as \u201cMorphine (not heroin).\u201d  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.<br /><br /> \u201cAny Opioid\u201d \u2013 If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it\u2019s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked. health.

These pillars are broken down into components that track the maturity of institutional systems. The components are in turn composed of indicators and minimum requirements that these systems must have in an MfDR environment. All of these measures (minimum requirements, indicators, components, and pillars) are scored on a scale from 0 to 5, where a 5 indicates an ideal institutional situation. <br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/c89t-dh9r</b></br></br>. finance;politics;uruguay;trinidad y tobago;suriname;peru;paraguay;panama;nicaragua;mexico;jamaica;honduras;haiti;guyana;guatemala;el salvador;ecuador;rep\u00fablica dominicana;costa rica;colombia;chile;barbados;bahamas;argentina;gprd;gesti\u00f3n para resultados en el desarrollo;mo.

In 2013, a new question was added to the survey and captured the types of prescription and over-the-counter analgesics used allowing the 2013 data to be reanalysed including and excluding non-opioid over-the-counter drugs such as paracetamol and aspirin.  In 2016, pain-killer/analgesics and opioids sections were combined into one section and references and questions about use of non-opioid over-the-counter (OTC) drugs such as paracetamol and aspirin were removed.  While analyses have been undertaken to make the 2013 and 2016 data as comparable as possible, the changes to the 2016 survey has resulted in a break in the time-series for pain-killers and opiates and also for the overall misuse of pharmaceuticals.

The geographic extent of the data set is 0 degrees E to 0 degrees W longitude and 75 degrees S to 90 degrees N latitude. Many of the undersea features (UF) in the shapefile were selected from a list assembled by Weatherall and Cramer (2008) in a report from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) to the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN). Annex II of the Weatherall and Cramer report (p. 20-22) lists 183 undersea features that \"may need additional points to define their shape\" and includes online links to additional BODC documents providing coordinate pairs sufficient to define detailed linestrings for these features. For the first phase of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) project, Wingfield created polygons for 87 of the undersea features on the BODC list, using the linestrings as guides; the selected features were primarily ridges, rises, trenches, fracture zones, basins, and seamount chains. In the second phase of the USGS project, Wingfield and Hartwell created polygons for an additional 224 undersea features, mostly basins, abyssal plains, and fracture zones.

The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend. The University of Colorado's Sea Level Research Group compares global sea level rates calculated by different research organizations and provides detailed explanations about the issues involved.. sea level;sea level changes;tide gauges;. ."

In the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, international organizations provided conflicting recommendations for disinfecting surfaces contaminated by uncontrolled patient spills. We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high \u00adtest hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre\u00adcleaning practices (pre\u00adwiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9\u00ad and 3.1\u00adlog removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy \u00adduty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts. Our results support the recommendation of a 15-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine, independently of chlorine type, surface, pre\u00ad-cleaning practices, and organic matter, as an efficacious measure to interrupt disease transmission from uncontrolled spills in Ebola outbreaks.. environment;economy;ebola; surface; disinfection; chlorine; e. coli; phi6.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.  Population estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.  Population estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.  Annual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.  The following is a. demographics;environment;vital signs. Raleigh McCoy."

Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities.

The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C.

SUMMARY</strong> In compliance with CA Government Code 6270.5 (passed via SB 272), the City must publish a catalog of enterprise systems that collect data about the public. There are certain exceptions to this detailed in the Government Code. The code is available here: http://bit.ly/CAinventory  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset changes infrequently and is uploaded manually as needed by DataSF staff  <strong>D.

Information on the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program can be found at https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp/.   Definitions of FMMP Types (polygon_ty values): Prime Farmland (P): Irrigated land with the best combination of physical and chemical features able to sustain long term production of agricultural crops. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Land must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.  Farmland of Statewide Importance (S): Irrigated land similar to Prime Farmland that has a good combination of physical and chemical characteristics for the production of agricultural crops. This land has minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture than Prime Farmland. Land must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.  Unique Farmland (U): Lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been cropped at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.  Farmland of Local Importance (L): All farmable lands within Fresno County that do not meet the definitions of Prime, Statewide, or Unique. This includes land that is or has been used for irrigated pasture, dryland farming, confined livestock and dairy, poultry facilities, aquaculture and grazing land. The Fresno County Board of Supervisors modified its Farmland of Local Importance definition in 2001, adding the confined animal agriculture component.  Grazing Land (G): Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock. This category is used only in California and was developed in cooperation with the California Cattlemen's Association, University of California Cooperative Extension, and other groups interested in the extent of grazing activities.  Urban and Built-Up Land (D): Urban and Built-Up land is occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. Common examples include residential, industrial, commercial, institutional facilities, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, and water control structures.  Other Land (X): Land which does not meet the criteria of any other category. Typical uses include low density rural development, heavily forested land, mined land, or government land with restrictions on use. This category was subdivided into R, V, Cl, sAC, and nv beginning with the 2006 data.  Water (W): Water areas with an extent of at least 40 acres.  Area not mapped (Z): Area which falls outside of the NRCS soil survey. Not mapped by the FMMP.  Rural Residential Land (R): This includes residential areas of one to five structures per ten acres.

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).     Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010.

Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Causes of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2).

This filtered view presents Real Gross Domestic Product for the professional, scientific, and technical services sector and its subsectors in the State of Iowa by year beginning in 1997.    Gross domestic product (GDP) is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within Iowa in a particular period of time. In concept, an industry's GDP by state, referred to as its \"value added\", is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus its intermediate inputs (consumption of goods and services purchased from other U.S. industries or imported). The Iowa GDP a state counterpart to the Nation's GDP, the Bureau's featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. Iowa GDP differs from national GDP for the following reasons: Iowa GDP excludes and national GDP includes the compensation of federal civilian and military personnel stationed abroad and government consumption of fixed capital for military structures located abroad and for military equipment, except office equipment; and Iowa GDP and national GDP have different revision schedules. GDP is reported in millions of current dollars.    Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure of Iowa's gross product that is based on national prices for the goods and services produced within Iowa. The real estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are measured in millions of chained dollars, but have been multiplied by 1,000,000 to display in dollars for visualization purposes.

NEW YORK CITY Results on the NEW YORK STATE English Language Arts (ELA) & Mathematics Exams  (Grades 3 - 8)    Notes   Starting in 2013, the NY State Education Department (NYSED) changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm  Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for \"matched\" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, \"matched\" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th \u2013 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.  For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.  Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults  In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   Former English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years.   A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014 and 2015: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempt from taking the 7th and 8th grade State math assessment. The numbers on the \"All - with Math Regents\" tab represent  the equivalent proficiency had the accelerated math students in 7th and 8th grade taken the State math assessment. An \"All Grades\" row represents how this would impact a school's overall proficiency.

The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.    Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.

Effective January 1, 2015, an individual who qualifies as a permit consultant under San Francisco law must register and file quarterly reports with the Ethics Commission. A permit consultant is an individual who receives or is promised compensation to provide permit consulting services on a \"major project\" or a \"minor project\", including any employee who receives compensation for time spent on permit consulting services.   \"Permit consulting services\" means any contact with the Department of Building Inspection, the Entertainment Commission, the Planning Department, or the Department of Public Works to help a permit applicant obtain a permit. \"Permit consulting services\" do not include simple requests for information which do not otherwise include attempts to help obtain a permit.   A \"major project\" is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 and which requires a permit issued by the Department of Building Inspection or the Planning Department. Estimated constructions costs are to be calculated in the same manner used to determine building permit fees under the Building Code. A \"minor project\" is a project located in the City and County of San Francisco which requires a permit issued by the Entertainment Commission.  The following individuals are not permit consultants and thus are not required to register or report:  -a licensed architect or engineer of record for construction activity allowed or contemplated by the permit, or an employee of that architect or engineer;  -a contractor who will be responsible for all construction activity associated with the requested permit, or an employee of that contractor; or  -an employee or agent of an organization with tax exempt status under 26 United States Code Section 501(c)(3) communicating on behalf of that organization regarding the development of a project for that organization.   Each permit consultant must register with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after providing permit consulting services.

To allow multiple classifications, the species model is separate from any specific classification. However many want these two aspects connected together.

This is particularly useful for browsing SPARQL query results with Microsoft Pivot. In addition, it is also possible to create similar mapping files that can be used to   tie the species to alternative classifications.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

Child well-being matters for both ethical and economic reasons as children who flourish in the early years are more likely to become healthy, productive citizens later in life. This year\u2019s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development\u2014physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional\u2014 does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children\u2019s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.      <br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/sg6f-m5te </b></br></br>. politics;education;early childhood; child welfare; child development; early childhood education.

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:      * the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;  * elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.      The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.    Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.    The BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers, it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs, judgements, articles from periodicals, contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.  . bibliographic data;bibliography;country-italy;library;lod;lodlam;rdf;rdf-format;.

The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora, which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the \"trivial\" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present, there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires, corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires, written in more than 240 different dialects, for a total of more than 54,000 sentences and more than 40,000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system..

The Underserved Areas File establishes underserved area designations for census tracts in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), nonmetropolitan parts of states and Federal and State American Indian Reservations and tribal and individual trust lands. The following are the definitions of underserved geographical areas based on HUDs housing goals regulations at 24 CFR Section 81.2. a. Central Cities and Other Parts of Metropolitan Areas (i) A census tract with median income at or below 120 percent of the median income of the metropolitan area (MSA) and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A census tract with median income at or below 90 percent of median income of the MSA. b. Nonmetropolitan Areas (i) A census tract with median income at or below 120 percent of the greater of the State nonmetropolitan median income or the nationwide nonmetropolitan median income and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A census tract with median income at or below 95 percent of the greater of the State nonmetropolitan median income or the nationwide nonmetropolitan median income. c. Tribal Lands in Metropolitan Areas (i) A Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land with a median income at or below 120 percent of the median income of the MSA and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land with a median income at or below 90 percent of median income of the MSA. d. Tribal Lands in Nonmetropolitan Areas (i) A Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land with a median income at or below 120 percent of the greater of the state nonmetropolitan median income or the nationwide nonmetropolitan median income and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land with a median income at or below 95 percent of the greater of the state nonmetropolitan median income or the nationwide nonmetropolitan median income. e. Tribal Lands that Cross Metropolitan / Nonmetropolitan Area and/or State Boundaries For certain Federal or State American Indian reservations or tribal or individual trust lands, the tribal area crosses an MSA or state boundary. In these cases, the median incomes of the MSA or MSAs, the nonmetropolitan area of the state or states, or the nationwide nonmetropolitan area that applies to the tract containing the tribal area determines whether the part of the Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land is underserved. METHODOLOGY: Whether a tract has 30 percent or more minority population is determined by rounding 30 percent of the tracts population to the nearest person, and comparing this to the count of minority persons in the area. The applicable percentage of area median income and whether the tracts median income is below it is determined by rounding the applicable percentage of area median income to the nearest dollar and comparing this to tract median family income.

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

Data provided by the California Department of Conservation Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP). The next, complete set of updated data will be released sometime in 2020.  Established in 1982, Government Code Section 65570 mandates the FMMP biennially report on the conversion of farmland and grazing land, and to provide maps and data to local government and the public. The data is a current inventory of agricultural resources. This data is for general planning purposes and has a minimum mapping unit of ten acres. Feature sets are distributed by the Department of Conservation, who release updates every two years for the counties updated during that period. Each decadal release (1990, 2000, and 2010) pulls together the complete set of updates for the period and released as a complete (for the counties the State maps) statewide feature set.  Information on the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program can be found at https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp/.   Definitions of FMMP Types (polygon_ty values): Prime Farmland (P): Irrigated land with the best combination of physical and chemical features able to sustain long term production of agricultural crops. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Land must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.  Farmland of Statewide Importance (S): Irrigated land similar to Prime Farmland that has a good combination of physical and chemical characteristics for the production of agricultural crops. This land has minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture than Prime Farmland. Land must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.  Unique Farmland (U): Lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been cropped at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.  Farmland of Local Importance (L): All farmable lands within Fresno County that do not meet the definitions of Prime, Statewide, or Unique. This includes land that is or has been used for irrigated pasture, dryland farming, confined livestock and dairy, poultry facilities, aquaculture and grazing land. The Fresno County Board of Supervisors modified its Farmland of Local Importance definition in 2001, adding the confined animal agriculture component.  Grazing Land (G): Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock. This category is used only in California and was developed in cooperation with the California Cattlemen's Association, University of California Cooperative Extension, and other groups interested in the extent of grazing activities.  Urban and Built-Up Land (D): Urban and Built-Up land is occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. Common examples include residential, industrial, commercial, institutional facilities, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, and water control structures.  Other Land (X): Land which does not meet the criteria of any other category. Typical uses include low density rural development, heavily forested land, mined land, or government land with restrictions on use. This category was subdivided into R, V, Cl, sAC, and nv beginning with the 2006 data.  Water (W): Water areas with an extent of at least 40 acres.  Area not mapped (Z): Area which falls outside of the NRCS soil survey. Not mapped by the FMMP.  Rural Residential Land (R): This includes residential areas of one to five structures per ten acres.

The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.

EPA approved this submission in accordance with Sections 303(d), 305(b), and 314(l) of the Clean Water Act, on October 16, 2015.  The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.

See report at:   To complete this special request project, we categorized recommendations and resolutions based on the following definitions:    Directly related to displacement or gentrification (\"direct\"):  Clearly and immediately impacts the population experiencing gentrification and displacement (e.g., creation of affordable housing units).     Indirectly related to displacement or gentrification (\"indirectly\"):  An initiative  designed to support direct efforts (such as monitoring or increasing funding for staffing). Alternatively, an indirect initiative may be one that is designed to affect the broad population (e.g., overall tax decrease), or the language is so vague or broad that the precise intention is unclear.     Actionable recommendations and resolutions (\"actionable\"):  Recommendations that are specific and implementable as written; recommendations that detail the specific site of an action.     Not actionable recommendations and resolutions (\"not actionable\"):  Things that do not appear to be legal; recommendations that are not implementable as worded or that would require significant additional clarification/research.. affordability;city-council;city-manager;displacement;gentrification;homelessness;housing;."

There are currently 108,175 species concepts and a and 1,000 records for species occurrences. There are also a few examples of references, and image galleries. I have added links below for an insect, mammal, bird and tree to serve as examples of the interlinking etc. The occurrence records are interlinked with GeoNames.     A species can have several different classifications, for instance it's classification in NCBI and DBpedia, are different. To allow multiple classifications, the species model is separate from any specific classification. However many want these two aspects connected together. To make this easy, I have created an additional owl:sameAs RDF dump file which makes the #Taxonomy the same as the #Species. This is particularly useful for browsing SPARQL query results with Microsoft Pivot. In addition, it is also possible to create similar mapping files that can be used to   tie the species to alternative classifications.

SOURCES: IBO; New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)  NOTES: 1In determining what to include as outstanding debt of the City of New York, IBO considered: (1) the city's obligation (contractual and moral) to repay the debt, (2) whether the revenues pledged toward the repayment of the debt would have otherwise accrued to the city, and (3) whether the proceeds of the debt issuance accrue directly to the city.  2GO debt is net of bonds held for debt service on other city-related obligations, referred to in the Comptroller's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as Treasury Obligations. The 2000\u20132002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.  3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.  4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly.   5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008                  General Obligation:  General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds.                                  Treasury Obligations:  Treasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.                  Transitional Finance Authority:  Created in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.                  TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:  In fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.                  TSASC:  TSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.                  Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:  The Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds.

The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program.     The QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers.     Data from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys.     In addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.    The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California\u2019s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends.

This table contains data from the community survey conducted as part of an Audit of the City's Cultural Centers. We surveyed members of the Austin community using a survey developed by the audit team. Survey questions generally asked respondents' opinions on cultural center programs, staff, fees, and facilities. The survey opened January 3 and closed January 27, 2020. Austin community members were invited to take the survey through social media outreach and direct email invitations. The survey and outreach materials were written in English and translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese. A total of 1,330 community members responded to the survey. Respondents were asked only to respond for centers they had visited in the last two years and could respond for more than one center. The comments detailed in this table were in response to open-ended survey items that allowed respondents to give opinions or suggestions about each center's programming, fees, staff, and facilities. Any open-ended responses answered in Spanish, Vietnamese, or Chinese were translated prior to analysis. To gauge the general sentiment of the responses, each was categorized as \"Positive,\" \"Negative,\" \"Suggestion,\" or \"N/A.\" During analysis, some comments were deemed more relevant to other open-ended survey items than the items for which they were originally written.

No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.

Graduation Outcomes - Class of 2010 - Math/ELA Aspirational Performance Measure (APM)   \u00b6\u2022The New York State Education Department adopted Aspirational Performance Measures (APM) in addition to high school graduation rates for the Cohort of 2006 (Class of 2010). In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August.   \u00b6\u2022Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed.   \u00b6\u2022August outcomes include all June and August graduates.   \u00b6\u2022In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school\u2019s cohort, but are included in citywide totals.   \u00b6\u2022School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.   \u00b6\u2022Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.. lifelong-learning;."

Citywide Class Size Report, including Region, District, School, Program, Grade or Service Category, Average Class Size, and Pupil / Teacher Ratio (PTR)     SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)  #Grade 9 not in high schools  ##Indicates how special class is delivered    For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.     The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, \u201ccluster\u201d teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.. lifelong-learning;."

The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data.

This shapefile (polygon feature) contains the boundary of the July 1, 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, one of the layers of the July 1, 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map. The latest adoption FRRM flood map was adopted on July 2020. This adoption was also based on the July 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map analysis because this represents the latest analysis of the floodplain. No changes have occurred in the geographic extent of the flood plain map since 2019.  Areas within this boundary are highly likely to experience \u201cdeep and contiguous\u201d flooding during a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm is a storm that has a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. \u201cDeep and contiguous flooding\u201d means flooding at least 6-inches deep spanning an area at least the size of half an average City block. The 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone does not provide the exact depth of flooding at a given location. It also does not show areas in the City that may experience shallower and/or more localized flooding in a 100-year storm, or areas of the City that may flood in storms larger than a 100-year storm. Finally, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone shows flood risk from storm runoff only. It does not consider flood risk in San Francisco from other causes such as inundation from the San Francisco Bay or Pacific Ocean. In addition to the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map shows other layers. The layer \u201cAreas not served by the Combined Sewer and Stormwater Collection System\u201d shows where data for rainfall driven storm runoff is not available.
