EPA approved this submission in accordance with Sections 303(d), 305(b), and 314(l) of the Clean Water Act, on October 16, 2015.  The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\".

This data set shows the planned funding allocations for HIV medical and support services in the Austin area from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part A. The HIV Planning Council, a City of Austin Board/Commission is the responsible body for the allocation of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part A funding. This program provides grant funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for medical and support services to the Austin Area. Allocation Plans are developed using data including but not limited to: epidemiological overview and demographic information for people living with HIV (PLWH), service utilization data, needs assessment data, and expenditure trends. Allocation Plans are developed based on a maximum amount of funds that can be applied as dictated by HRSA for each grant year. Actual awarded Ryan White Part A amounts may differ from the plan.  The HIV Planning Council sets alternative funding scenario plans to adapt the Allocation Plan to the actual amount of Part A funds awarded. The HIV Planning Council can re-allocate awarded funds at any time during the grant year to reflect changes in service needs or the ability to expend funds in each service category. Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) funding is a subset of Ryan White Part A which funds services for populations disproportionately affected by HIV.. allocations;hiv;hiv-aids;hiv-planning-council;hrsa;planning-council;priority-setting-resource-allocation;resource-allocations;ryan-white;."

They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.    Potentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.

This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights trends in age-adjusted death rates for five selected major causes of death.  Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses.

This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.<br /> The Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.</p> <p>As part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete.</p> <p>CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program<br /> On March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.</p> <p>Since expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.</p> <p>Provider Relief Fund Data - <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-COVID-19-High-Impact-Payments/b58h-s9zx\">https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-COVID-19-High-I...</a></p> . accelerated-and-advance-payments;cares-act;coronavirus;covid-19;provider-relief-fund;."

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend. The University of Colorado's Sea Level Research Group compares global sea level rates calculated by different research organizations and provides detailed explanations about the issues involved.. sea level;sea level changes;tide gauges;. ."

SUMMARY Feature class includes geographic boundaries of neighborhoods in San Francisco identified as Muni Service Equity Strategy Neighborhoods.  These are defined for the Muni Service Equity Policy adopted by the SFMTA Board of Directors in May 2014.  For more information on this strategy refer to the latest FY Year 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 report: https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/agendaitems/2016/4-5-16%20Item%2013%20Muni%20Equity%20Strategy%20Report_1.pdf  B. METHODOLOGY  Boundaries were created through geospatial analysis of demographic data using census tracts and defined boundaries of city planning neighborhoods. The following criteria was used in selecting neighborhood concentrations of households with low income, concentrations of residents who identify with a race other than white, zero vehicle ownership households, and concentrations of affordable and public housing developments.  C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  Geospatial analysis conducted in concurrence with bi-annual Muni Service Equity Strategy report    D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Not all equity strategy neighborhood boundaries use their defined city planning neighborhood boundaries.

Note:  Please use the following view to be able to see the entire Dataset Description: https://data.ct.gov/Environment-and-Natural-Resources/Hazardous-Waste-Portal-Manifest-Metadata/x2z6-swxe  Dataset Description Outline (5 sections)  \u2022 INTRODUCTION  \u2022 WHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF?  \u2022 WHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA?  \u2022 HOW DOES THE PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET RELATE TO THE OTHER TWO MANIFEST DATASETS PUBLISHED IN CT OPEN DATA?  \u2022 IMPORTANT NOTES  INTRODUCTION \u2022 All of DEEP\u2019s paper hazardous waste manifest records were recently scanned and \u201cindexed\u201d.  \u2022 Indexing consisted of 6 basic pieces of information or \u201cmetadata\u201d taken from each manifest about the Generator and stored with the scanned image.  The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment. \u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/ \u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information. \u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.  WHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF? The Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal:  \u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500); \u2022 larger display of search returns; \u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and \u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format) \u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images.  The main advantages of the Portal are: \u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and \u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time.   WHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA? All hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including: \u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment \u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed) \u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number) \u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator \u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018. \u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting.   All other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.  They were discarded after 2 years in accord with DEEP records retention schedule.  Non-hazardous manifests include: \u2022 Manifests with only non-RCRA hazardous waste listed \u2022 Manifests from generators that did not have a permanent or temporary Generator ID number \u2022 Sometimes non-hazardous manifests were considered \u201cHazar. generator;hazardous-waste;manifest;rcra;shipment;shipped;waste;."

The Program is administered by Public Works and its objective is to keep residential household hazardous waste (HHW - e.g., paint, solvents, chemicals, etc.) from being disposed at municipal solid waste landfills. The Program provides a free and convenient means for residents to manage their HHW by conducting weekly collection events throughout the County. In late 2002, the Program was expanded to include the collection of electronic waste (E Waste - e.g., televisions, computers, cell phones, etc.). The Program serves all 88 cities and the unincorporated communities in the County. On average, 55 mobile collection events are conducted throughout the County annually, where about 8 million pounds of HHW are collected. Participation at the events has reached close to 80,000 households annually.. environment;infrastructure;economy. Christian Alcazar."

They are provided to customers already receiving benefits through a variety of federal, state, county or city assistance programs. In February 2014, the Austin City Council voted to expand the discount program to 45,000 customers a year.  Additionally, in 2015 the Austin City Council voted to no longer have a waitlist as well as include Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers as a qualifier.  Under the program, qualifying Austin Energy customers receive a waiver of the $10 monthly electric customer charge; are exempt from paying the portion of the community benefit charge that supports the Utility Bill Discount Program; and they receive a 10% discount on their kWh usage charge. Austin Water customers also receive a discount on the water/wastewater customer charge as well as a volumetric discount on a customer\u2019s water usage. Watershed Protection provides a 50% discount on the drainage fee. Public Works under a separate qualification waives the transportation user fee.    Customers who qualify for utility bill discounts are receiving an average of $792 per year per family, $248 of which comes from Austin Energy.

The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year.  The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous.  For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.  (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

Currently, CDC provides the public with COVID-19 case surveillance data in two ways: an 11 data element public use dataset of the line-listed dataset of all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC and a 31 data element <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t\">restricted access dataset</a> of the line-listed dataset of all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC.  The following are true for both the public use dataset and the restricted access dataset:  - Data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at <a href=\"www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf\">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf</a>.  - Data are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.  - Data are suppressed to protect individual privacy.  - The datasets include all cases with an initial report date of case to CDC at least 14 days prior to the creation of the previously updated datasets. This 14-day lag will allow case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.  - Datasets are updated monthly.   - Both datasets are created using CDC\u2019s operational Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access and include protections designed to protect individual privacy.  - For more information about data collection and reporting, please see <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html\">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html</a>  - For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a>  Overview  The COVID-19 case surveillance system database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and states. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the Nationally Notifiable Condition List and classified as \u201cimmediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\u201d by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (Interim-20-ID-01). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and shared voluntarily with CDC.

To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.

This report provides a weekly summary of deaths with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by select geographic and demographic variables. In this release, counts of deaths are provided by the race and Hispanic origin of the decedent. Topics will be added to the release as they become available.  These provisional counts are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. Data shown on this page may be incomplete and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Data on this page are revised weekly and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1\u20132 weeks.  Weighted population distributions more accurately reflect race/ethnic distributions of the geographic locations where COVID outbreaks are occurring (see below for the methods used to calculate weighted percentages). The weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. See Table 2 below for unweighted populations.  Estimated distributions of COVID-19 deaths and population size by race and Hispanic origin  The percentages of COVID-19 deaths by race and Hispanic origin were calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths for each race and Hispanic origin group by the total number of COVID-19 deaths. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. The distribution of deaths involving COVID-19 by race/ethnicity should not be compared to the race/ethnicity distribution of the U.S. population because COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain geographic locations where the racial and ethnic population distribution differs from that of the United States overall. Additionally, COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain areas within states, and it is therefore not appropriate to compare the percent of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity to the racial/ethnic population distribution of a given state.  To make the estimated population distribution more comparable to the geographic areas where COVID-19 deaths are occurring, weighted population distributions are provided in this report. The weighted population distributions were calculated as follows. County-level population counts by race and Hispanic origin were multiplied by the corresponding total count of COVID-19 deaths by county (of residence). These weighted counts were then summed to the state (or national) level. The percentage of the population within each race and Hispanic origin group by state (or for the U.S.) was then estimated using these weighted counts. Counties with no COVID-19 deaths received a weight of zero, and thus do not contribute to the weighted population totals. Population counts for counties with large numbers of COVID-19 deaths are upweighted proportional to their numbers of COVID-19 deaths. These weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. For example, assume that 75% of the total number of COVID deaths occurred in a single county, County X, while the other 25% of COVID deaths occurred in County Y, and all other counties reported zero deaths. The weighted population counts for County X would contribute 75% of the total population counts, while the population counts for Count. coronavirus;covid-19;deaths;ethnicity;mortality;nchs;population;race;state;united-states;."

National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified that have been received and coded. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks.</p> <p>The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), and pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19; (a) by week ending date, (b) by age at death, and (c) by specific jurisdictions. Future updates to this release may include additional detail such as demographic characteristics (e.g., sex), additional causes of death (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome or other comorbidities), or estimates based on models that account for reporting delays to generate more accurate predicted provisional counts.</p> <p>Pneumonia deaths are included to provide context for understanding the completeness of COVID-19 mortality data and related trends. Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition. Thus, increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality. Additionally, estimates of completeness for pneumonia deaths may provide context for understanding the lag in reporting for COVID-19 deaths, as it is anticipated that these causes would have similar delays in reporting, processing, and coding. However, it is possible that reporting of COVID-19 mortality may be slower or faster than for other causes of death, and that the delay may change over time. Analyses to better understand and quantify reporting delays for COVID-19 deaths and related causes are underway. The list of causes provided in these tables may expand in future releases as more data are received, and other potentially comorbid conditions are determined.</p> <p>Technical notes</p> <p>Comparing data in this report to other sources</p> <p>Provisional death counts in this report will not match counts in other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Death data, once received and processed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), are tabulated by the state or jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent\u2019s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems.  Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cause.  Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths.  This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources.

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.  <strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> In compliance with CA Government Code 6270.5 (passed via SB 272), the City must publish a catalog of enterprise systems that collect data about the public. There are certain exceptions to this detailed in the Government Code. The code is available here: http://bit.ly/CAinventory  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset changes infrequently and is uploaded manually as needed by DataSF staff  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Companion dataset inventory dataset</em> A companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Dataset-inventory/y8fp-fbf5\">dataset of inventoried and published datasets can be accessed online</a> as well.. demographics;environment;ref:inventory;sb272;sb 272;gov code 6270.5;systems;open data;inventory.

This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for  1270 traffic segments, in selected time periods from August 2011 to May 2018. Newer records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.    The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/Vz3rIh.. historical;sustainability;traffic;."

The Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs) provide a means for measuring the contribution of transportation services to the national economy. Prior to the TSAs, the magnitude of transportation services had long been underestimated, as most national measures counted only the value of for-hire services. Measurement of services provided only by for-hire firms misses the sizable contribution of transportation services that take place within nontransportation industries, termed as in-house transportation.    To more accurately measure transportation services, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, jointly developed the Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs). The TSAs, as a supplement to the U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, measure the contribution of both for-hire and in-house transportation.

In this manuscript, we synthesize current and legacy data from multiple studies to better understand the distribution and diversity of soil types and their properties in the Plateau physiographic region of the West Usamabara Mountains in Northeastern Tanzania. Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 \u2013 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were  identified as the most likely limiting nutrients in West Usambaran plateau soils in general. This information is critical for sustainable land management which will be applicable to the soils of other mountain complexes in the Eastern Arc chain.. finance;economy;landscape position;tanzania;total;bray p;exchangeable k;tn;cation exchange capacity;acrisols;ultisols;land use;elevation;ph;soc;west usambara mountains.

In the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, international organizations provided conflicting recommendations for disinfecting surfaces contaminated by uncontrolled patient spills. We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high \u00adtest hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre\u00adcleaning practices (pre\u00adwiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9\u00ad and 3.1\u00adlog removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy \u00adduty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts. Our results support the recommendation of a 15-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine, independently of chlorine type, surface, pre\u00ad-cleaning practices, and organic matter, as an efficacious measure to interrupt disease transmission from uncontrolled spills in Ebola outbreaks.. environment;economy;ebola; surface; disinfection; chlorine; e. coli; phi6.

SUMMARY</strong> Medical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.  Cases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.  Dataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to March 2nd, 2020 when testing began. It is updated daily.  Geographic areas summarized are: 1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a> 2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a> 3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> Addresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2018 ACS estimates for population provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to ([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> Geographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset each day.  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Privacy rules in effect</em> To protect privacy, certain rules are in effect: 1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values 2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values 3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000  <em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em> Rates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.  <em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em> ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.  <em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em> A single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality. While some cases cannot be mapped to sub-areas like Census Tracts, ongoing data quality efforts result in improved mapping on a rolling bases.. ."

Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.  Examples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected.   Data limitations and factors to consider when using this data:  This data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.  This dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center.   For a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

The IDBA relies on a comprehensive approach based on four pillars: infrastructure, applications and capacity, strategic regulations, and public policy and strategic vision. Those four pillars are built as a result of the combination of 37 indicators from renowned international institutions.

The list includes all major worldwide newspapers  and a wide range of topics, e.g.,  World  ,  U.S.  ,  Business  ,  Sci-  ence  etc. The RSS list has been compiled using a 76-hour  crawl, which resulted in a corpus of about 11.7 million sen-  tences. A subset of this corpus has been created by ran-  domly selecting 1% of the contained sentences.  Finally, one researcher annotated 500 randomly chosen  sentences manually. These sentences were a subset of  those which contained a natural language representation  of a formal relation, like \u201c. . . , who was born in. . . \u201d for  dpo:birthPlace  (see (Gerber and Ngomo, 2012)).

Only the first report is counted in the data presented here. Laboratories are required to electronically report positive hepatitis B test results, as well as negative results for hepatitis B DNA. The Health Department does not routinely investigate hepatitis B reports because of the large volume; therefore it is difficult to determine when people with these infections were first infected, although most were probably infected a while ago. Case counts represent people newly reported with hepatitis B and are not prevalence or incidence. Many people with hepatitis B are asymptomatic; as a result, many cases are not diagnosed or reported.

Residential customers live in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units.     The majority of commercial customers are small to large businesses that fall under Austin Energy\u2019s secondary level of service. This means Austin Energy owns, operates, and maintains the equipment (wires, transformers, etc.) supplying power to those facilities.     Industrial (Primary) customers take service at high voltage (12,500 volts or higher) and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and it costs less to serve these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, high-tech facilities, and data centers typically fall under the primary level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7.

Abstract: This digitized collection contains approximately 90,000 images of Residential Assessment Records (a.k.a. \u201cfield cards\u201d) created by the Tax Assessors Department of the City of Providence, Rhode Island. These cards contain information on structural conditions of buildings (e.g., grades of condition for foundations, walls, roofs, building materials, etc.) organized by, street address, and plat & lot number within the City of Providence.  The verso of these cards contains structural diagrams, land valuations, and cost computations.  -----------------------------------------------------------  Finding aid:  Providence City Field Assessment Records   -----------------------------------------------------------    Series 1: 1940  -----------------------------------------------------------    Creator: Providence City Archives  ------------------------------------------------------------    Language of materials: English  ------------------------------------------------------    Repository: Providence City Archives  -------------------------------------------------------  Record Group Number: RG 131.3  --------------------------------------------------------  Scope and Content: The field cards were developed as a measure to accurately grade the value of a structure for tax purposes within the City of Providence.  The strength of the collection, contemporarily, concerns the sections under \u201cLand Valuation\u201d on the verso of the digitized documents, particularly the status for which a building was zoned for (eg., house, apartment, industrial, or commercial structure, etc.).  This information helps distinguish the maximum amount of tenants a residential building can have within code. Other areas of interest include quality assessments from building materials to structural condition (eg., cost computation of values before and after deductions of existing conditions and improvements of a structure).   -------------------------------------------------------------  Arrangement: The field cards are digitized and arranged in the Socrata database system accessed by address + plat/lot.   ------------------------------------------------------------------  Access to the collection: There are no restrictions to access.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Use of materials: The materials are within public domain.

Abstract: This digitized collection contains approximately 90,000 images of Residential Assessment Records (a.k.a. \u201cfield cards\u201d) created by the Tax Assessors Department of the City of Providence, Rhode Island. These cards contain information on structural conditions of buildings (e.g., grades of condition for foundations, walls, roofs, building materials, etc.) organized by, street address, and plat & lot number within the City of Providence.  The verso of these cards contains structural diagrams, land valuations, and cost computations.  -----------------------------------------------------------  Finding aid:  Providence City Field Assessment Records   -----------------------------------------------------------    Series 1: 1940  -----------------------------------------------------------    Creator: Providence City Archives  ------------------------------------------------------------    Language of materials: English  ------------------------------------------------------    Repository: Providence City Archives  -------------------------------------------------------  Record Group Number: RG 131.3  --------------------------------------------------------  Scope and Content: The field cards were developed as a measure to accurately grade the value of a structure for tax purposes within the City of Providence.  The strength of the collection, contemporarily, concerns the sections under \u201cLand Valuation\u201d on the verso of the digitized documents, particularly the status for which a building was zoned for (eg., house, apartment, industrial, or commercial structure, etc.).  This information helps distinguish the maximum amount of tenants a residential building can have within code. Other areas of interest include quality assessments from building materials to structural condition (eg., cost computation of values before and after deductions of existing conditions and improvements of a structure).   -------------------------------------------------------------  Arrangement: The field cards are digitized and arranged in the Socrata database system accessed by address + plat/lot.   ------------------------------------------------------------------  Access to the collection: There are no restrictions to access.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Use of materials: The materials are within public domain. However, researchers are kindly asked to cite the Providence City Archives if reproduced.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Preferred citation:  Residential Assessment Records, RG131.3, Providence City Archives.. economy;housing & development;infrastructure;archives;assessment.

Child Protective Investigations (CPI) conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR).  Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety.  Completed investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim. Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases. A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the CPS glossary.   At the end of a completed investigation, CPI assesses child safety, the risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future, the ability of the family to reduce the risk without CPI intervention, the ability of CPI to provide needed services and other circumstances in the case to decide whether to provide ongoing services.   The Case Action Family Substitute Care includes investigations that resulted in at least one child (not necessarily all children in the home) being removed.

Also, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed: 1.

This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016. 2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.

                "text": "Essential Habitat Connectivity Areas (2010). The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and now the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) commissioned the California Essential Habitat Connectivity Project because a functional network of connected wildlands is essential to the continued support of California's diverse natural communities in the face of human development and climate change.  The Essential Connectivity Map depicts large, relatively natural habitat blocks that support native biodiversity (Natural Landscape Blocks) and areas essential for ecological connectivity between them (Essential Connectivity Areas). This coarse-scale map was based primarily on the concept of ecological integrity, rather than the needs of particular species.  Essential Connectivity Areas are placeholder polygons that can inform land-planning efforts, but that should eventually be replaced by more detailed Linkage Designs, developed at finer resolution based on the needs of particular species and ecological processes. It is important to recognize that even areas outside of Natural Landscape Blocks and Essential Connectivity Areas support important ecological values that should not be \"written off\" as lacking conservation value. Furthermore, because the Essential Habitat Connectivity Map was created at the statewide scale, based on available statewide data layers, and ignored Natural Landscape Blocks smaller than 2,000 acres squared, it has errors of omission that should be addressed at regional and local scales.  The Essential Connectivity data represents a statewide network of 850 relatively intact Natural Landscape Blocks (ranging in size from 2,000 to about 3.7 million acres) connected by 192 Essential Connectivity Areas (Table 3.1). There are fewer Essential Connectivity Areas than Natural Landscape Blocks, because each Essential Connectivity Area serves to connect at least two, and as many as 15 Natural Landscape Blocks. Due to the broad, statewide nature of this data, and its focus on connecting very large blocks of mostly protected natural lands, the network omits many areas that are important to biological conservation. The purpose of the map is to focus attention on large areas important to maintaining ecological integrity at the broadest scale. Natural areas excluded from this broad-brush Essential Connectivity Network can therefore not be \"written off\" as unimportant to connectivity conservation or to sustaining California's natural heritage.. infrastructure;environment;transportation;pba50;eir;basis. msmith."

HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em> This dataset has 3 dates: 1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself 2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform 3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date  Note that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process.   First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.   Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.  <em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em> This is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.. catalog;inventory;open-data;ref-inventory;."

At its core is the ISOcat registry ISOcat.org, a collaborative platform to hold a (to be standardized) set of data catgories (i.e., field descriptors). Descriptors have definitions in natural language and little explicit interrelations. With the registry growing to many hundred entries, authored by many, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the rather informal definitions and their glossary-like design make it hard for users to grasp, exploit and manage the registry\u2019s content. Here we take a large subset of the ISOcat term set and reconstruct from it a tree structure following the footsteps of schema.org. Our ontological re-engineering yields a representation that gives users a hierarchical view of linguistic, metadata-related terminology. The new representation adds to the precision of all definitions by making explicit information which is only implicitly given in the ISOcat registry. It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set. The new representation can serve as a complement to the existing ISOcat model, providing additional support for authors and users in browsing, (re-)using, maintaining, and further extending the community\u2019s terminological metadata repertoire.    The set of data categories has been taken from the TDG Metadata of the ISOcat data category registry. As the ISOcat registry changes over time, we give a snapshot of all data in this RDF representation, as generated automatically from the registry's export functionality in Dec 2011. Note that this data is a flat representation of the TDG Metadata entries.

The OLiA Reference Model itself is linked to community-maintained repositories such as GOLD (http://linguistics-ontology.org/) and ISOcat (http://www.isocat.org)    The OLiA ontologies were originally developed as part of an infrastructure for the sustainable maintenance of linguistic resources (http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/c2/index-engl.html), their fields of application include the formalization of annotation schemes, concept-based querying over heterogeneously annotated corpora, and the development of interoperable NLP pipelines.. annotation;corpus;crossdomain;language_description;linguistics;llod;lod;lodcloud-diagram-2014-08-30;nlp;terminology;.

At its core is the ISOcat registry ISOcat.org, a collaborative platform to hold a (to be standardized) set of data catgories (i.e., field descriptors). Descriptors have definitions in natural language and little explicit interrelations. With the registry growing to many hundred entries, authored by many, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the rather informal definitions and their glossary-like design make it hard for users to grasp, exploit and manage the registry\u2019s content. Here we take a large subset of the ISOcat term set and reconstruct from it a tree structure following the footsteps of schema.org. Our ontological re-engineering yields a representation that gives users a hierarchical view of linguistic, metadata-related terminology. The new representation adds to the precision of all definitions by making explicit information which is only implicitly given in the ISOcat registry. It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set. The new representation can serve as a complement to the existing ISOcat model, providing additional support for authors and users in browsing, (re-)using, maintaining, and further extending the community\u2019s terminological metadata repertoire.    The set of data categories has been taken from the TDG Metadata of the ISOcat data category registry. As the ISOcat registry changes over time, we give a snapshot of all data in this RDF representation, as generated automatically from the registry's export functionality in Dec 2011. Note that this data is a flat representation of the TDG Metadata entries. Each entry is only represented in RDF with its mnemonic identifier, name, persistent identifier and natural language definition.

In this manuscript, we synthesize current and legacy data from multiple studies to better understand the distribution and diversity of soil types and their properties in the Plateau physiographic region of the West Usamabara Mountains in Northeastern Tanzania. Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 \u2013 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were  identified as the most likely limiting nutrients in West Usambaran plateau soils in general. This information is critical for sustainable land management which will be applicable to the soils of other mountain complexes in the Eastern Arc chain.. finance;economy;landscape position;tanzania;total;bray p;exchangeable k;tn;cation exchange capacity;acrisols;ultisols;land use;elevation;ph;soc;west usambara mountains.

TAXREF-LD is a joint initiative of the National Museum of Natural History (http://www.mnhn.fr/) and the I3S laboratory (http://www.i3s.unice.fr/) (Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur, CNRS, Inria). Its model is described in [1].    [1] Michel F., Gargominy O., Tercerie S. & Faron-Zucker C. (2017). A Model to Represent Nomenclatural and Taxonomic Information as Linked Data.

By publishing a data inventory, city departments may help to stimulate new and innovative ideas from the community.   \u2022 Increase internal sharing and resilience. A data inventory can also help us access information from other departments that we need to improve service delivery and resilience planning.   \u2022 Enabling better and more up-to-date processes. The process of publishing a data inventory will help us to realize the constraints of current City technology and processes, and then plan for future improvements.   \u2022 Changing how we use data.

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.  <strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> The dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em> This dataset has 3 dates: 1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself 2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform 3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date  Note that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process.   First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.   Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.  <em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em> This is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.. catalog;inventory;open-data;ref-inventory;."

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.  <strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> The dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em> This dataset has 3 dates: 1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself 2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform 3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date  Note that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process.   First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.   Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.  <em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em> This is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.. economy;public safety;environment;ref:inventory;catalog;open data;inventory.

Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.    All crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. As per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.. public-safety;traffic-crashes;transportation;vision-zero;."

This budget is at the Fund, Department, Unit level.  This data set includes a build date and will be updated on a quarterly basis.  The data contained in this data set is for informational purposes. Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002.    The comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages\u2014full-time, regular wages\u2014part-time or regular wages\u2014civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category.    Personnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages\u2014full-time, regular wages\u2014part-time and regular wages\u2014civil service.

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:      * the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;  * elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.      The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.    Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.

The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora, which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the \"trivial\" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present, there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires, corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires, written in more than 240 different dialects, for a total of more than 54,000 sentences and more than 40,000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system..

Children are especially sensitive to lead exposure. The legal definition of an elevated blood lead level in Maryland is 10 micrograms/deciliter (mcg/dL), but the current CDC and Maryland guidelines for health care providers urge follow up for any child with a level of 5 mcg/dL or higher.  Children most often are exposed to lead if they swallow dust containing lead paint, usually when there is peeling, flaking, or chipping lead paint or from home renovation. Maryland health care providers are now supposed to test all children born on or after January 1, 2015 at their 12 and 24 month well child visits.   \". health;education;mdh;ship;environment;mdp;blood lead;child;state health improvement process.

These data are an indicator of children younger that 6 years of age tested in NYC in a given year with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater.    About the Data    All NYC children are required to be tested for lead poisoning at around age 1 and age 2, and to be screened for risk of lead poisoning, and tested if at risk, up until age 6. These data are an indicator of children younger that 6 years of age tested in NYC in a given year with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. The reference level is determined by measuring the NHANES blood lead distribution in US children ages 1 to 5 years, and is reviewed every 4 years.. demographics;education;infrastructure;lead;child;blood;elevated.
