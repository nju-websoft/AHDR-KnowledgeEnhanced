This English corpus is based on the well known Reuters-21578 corpus which contains economic news articles. In particular, we chose 128 articles containing at least one NE. Compared to the News-100 corpus the documents of Reuters-128 are significantly shorter and thus carry a smaller context.    To create the annotation of NEs with URIs, we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First, FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al., 2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards, the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore, the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially, but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases.

This filtered view presents Real Gross Domestic Product for the Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector and subsectors in the State of Iowa by year beginning in 1997.    Gross domestic product (GDP) is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within Iowa in a particular period of time. In concept, an industry's GDP by state, referred to as its \"value added\", is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus its intermediate inputs (consumption of goods and services purchased from other U.S. industries or imported). The Iowa GDP a state counterpart to the Nation's GDP, the Bureau's featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. Iowa GDP differs from national GDP for the following reasons: Iowa GDP excludes and national GDP includes the compensation of federal civilian and military personnel stationed abroad and government consumption of fixed capital for military structures located abroad and for military equipment, except office equipment; and Iowa GDP and national GDP have different revision schedules. GDP is reported in millions of current dollars.    Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure of Iowa's gross product that is based on national prices for the goods and services produced within Iowa. The real estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are measured in millions of chained dollars, but have been multiplied by 1,000,000 to display in dollars for visualization purposes.

These are local mean sea level trends, displayed on a map.    The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

Beneficiary survey data from Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI)    The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implementation of ongoing or future programs. The evaluation sought to identify: 1) implementation challenges, corrective actions to project management, and progress towards achieving expected results; 2) the factors that contributed to the success/failure of the different project components; 3) the effect of the activity on men and women; and 4) the extent to which SEBI contributed to the local social enterprise (SE) policy environment. The evaluation will serve to inform the United States Agency for International Development Jamaica Mission\u2019s (USAID/Jamaica) Local Partner Development (LPD) program under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) as well as the Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA), which is in the process of being registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO), with a view to continuing some of the work of SEBI once the project ends in December 2018. The exact nature of SEJA\u2019s activities is unclear, although the Evaluation Team (ET) understands that the focus could primarily be on incubation services for SEs under the LPD program.    SEBI was initiated by the Jamaica National Foundation (JNF) and jointly funded by JNF and USAID. The rationale for USAID\u2019s decision to support SEBI in Jamaica, implemented by (JNF), was based on several important factors at the time, namely: 1) low levels of business competitiveness and productivity; 2) a stagnant economy; 3) a high debt burden; and 4) high levels of crime in the country. The genesis of SEBI was in JNF\u2019s observation that not-for-profit and other organizations operating in the social sector were struggling to deliver their core services mainly due to a reliance on grants and donations. The underlying goal therefore was to introduce the social enterprise model to these organizations so that they could start generating their own income and become less reliant on grants and donations. SEBI began in July 2012 and is due for completion at the end of December 2018, following three extensions agreed in Modifications 2, 3, and 5 in the Cooperative Agreement (CA).     The ET pursued three separate, yet interlinked, data collection activities that formed the basis of its methodological approach to conducting the SEBI evaluation as follows:  1. Face-to-face meetings on site with SEBI\u2019s incubator and accelerator beneficiary clients as well as representatives from key stakeholders,  including national and local government, the private sector, international community, civil society, NGOs, and business associations and agencies. In total, the ET met with 29 beneficiaries (20 incubators and 13 accelerators) and 30 stakeholders. Team members used semi-structured questionnaires to record answers for later comparative analysis and cross-reference purposes with findings from the other data collection methods, mentioned below.   2. The ET hosted four focus group discussions (FGDs) in the parishes (Trelawny, St. James, Westmoreland and Manchester) and one in Kingston with selected groups of SEBI indirect beneficiaries. In total, 31 participants attended the FGDs, providing views and responses to questions which were noted for later cross-referencing with findings from the direct beneficiary and public awareness surveys.   3. Two surveys were carried out by Market Research Services Limited (MRSL), based in Kingston, on behalf of the ET (see Annex 6 \u2013 Survey Reports for complete analysis of the findings from both surveys).. demographics;health;infrastructure;social;enterprise;boost;initiative;jamaica.

The study finds that the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region lags well behind other regions in terms of financial depth, as measured by gross private domestic financial assets. LAC countries also have a larger share of bank deposits and cash in the private sector portfolio, compared to non-bank assets (bonds and shares). Moreover, within the institutional investor industry, pension funds are relatively developed in the region, although they grew out of the compulsory pension systems in several countries that date back to the 1980s and 1990s. The findings also indicate that LAC countries have about 40 percent of gross private financial wealth invested abroad, but just 4 percent of gross private liabilities have that origin, which attests to region\u2019s obstacles in tapping international markets. The countries in general present a small share of household and business saving being intermediated through the financial system.

Compared to the News-100 corpus the documents of Reuters-128 are significantly shorter and thus carry a smaller context.    To create the annotation of NEs with URIs, we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First, FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al., 2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards, the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore, the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially, but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases.

The data presented here contains offshore fault geometries, locations, ages, slip rates, and relevant published reference information for the San Francisco Bay Region and its surrounding counties. Metropolitan Transportation Commission staff extracted the data from a statewide feature set provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This polyline feature set has been compiled from previously published mapping where relatively dense, high-resolution marine geophysical data exist.  This compilation represents a significant update to previous national and regional fault datasets, which have been developed without the benefit of new high-resolution datasets. The geodatabase has been designed for easy ingestion by partners including the California Geological Survey and the USGS Quaternary Fault and Fold Database, and to be used to improve seismic hazards products, especially the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps, the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, and the Southern California Earthquake Center Community Fault Model. Other stakeholders include academic scientists, consultants, community planners and managers, the risk assessment community, and the general public.  In the last decade, a number of new marine geophysical datasets collected by the USGS, the Ocean Exploration Trust, and other organizations has led to substantially improved high-resolution mapping of the seafloor in areas including California's mainland State waters and the southern California continental borderland. Data include comprehensive multibeam bathymetry, seismic-reflection, and marine magnetic data in numerous offshore areas. Most of these data have been processed, merged, and released by the USGS in maps, data releases, and journal publications in support of the California Seafloor Mapping Program and the U.S. West Coast and Alaska Marine Geohazards Project. Improved data coverage has allowed researchers to better map offshore faults in areas previously unmapped or covered only by low-resolution data.

An expense or payment is not an \"activity expense\" unless it is incurred or made within three months of a contact with the officer, candidate, or Supervisor's aide who benefits from the expense or payment, or whose immediate family member or registered domestic partner benefits from the expense or payment. \"Activity expenses\" include honoraria, consulting fees, salaries, and any other thing of value totaling more than $25 in value in a consecutive three-month period, but do not include political contributions.Activity expenses are disclosed by lobbyists registered with the Ethics Commission on a monthly basis.

These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

Additionally, this excludes criminal incidents that fall under Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. The criminal code that is used here is based on the most serious violation of the incident. For example, if a break & enter occurred that involved an aggravated assault, only the aggravated assault would be counted.     It's important to note that incident-level data is a distinct measure for crime and will not match exactly with other EPS-reported statistics. There are two notable cases of this.

Alternative Fuels Data Center - Overview of tail pipe emissions from hybrid vehicles nationally, by state    __Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles__    Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do. When measuring well-to-wheel emissions, the electricity source is important: for PHEVs and EVs, part or all of the power provided by the battery comes from off-board sources of electricity. There are emissions associated with the majority of electricity production in the United States.    __Electricity Sources and Emissions__    EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have a well-to-wheel emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional fossil fuels for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a well-to-wheel emissions benefit.    __Direct and Well-to-Wheel Emissions__    Vehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a direct basis and a well-to-wheel basis.    Direct emissions are emitted through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. EVs produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. And when using the internal combustion engine, PHEVs also produce tailpipe emissions. However, their direct emissions are typically lower than those of comparable conventional vehicles.    Well-to-wheel emissions include all emissions related to fuel production, processing, distribution, and use. In the case of gasoline, emissions are produced while extracting petroleum from the earth, refining it, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning it in vehicles. In the case of electricity, most electric power plants produce emissions, and there are additional emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and distribution of the primary energy sources they use for electricity production.

The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.  Workers\u2019 compensation indemnity benefits are cash benefits paid to injured workers. These benefits include benefits for temporary disability (time loss), permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, and death. Statute sets eligibility criteria and the rates at which insurers pay these benefits. In the case of death from work-related causes, indemnity benefits are paid to survivors. Indemnity benefits also include vocational assistance benefits paid on behalf of severely disabled workers to get them back to work.  Indemnity benefits also include settlements between workers and insurers. Claim disposition agreements (CDAs) and disputed claim settlements (DCSs) are the two forms of settlements.  The Workers' Benefit Fund ( WBF)provides funds for programs that assist employers and injured workers. Assessment revenues, not insurance premiums, finance these programs. Employers and workers each pay half the assessment. The two major programs are the Retroactive Program and the Re-employment Assistance Program.  The Retroactive Program pays cost-of-living increases to workers or their beneficiaries based on changes in average wages. The two major benefits paid are for permanent total disability and death. Since at least 1995, the majority of PTD and death benefits have been paid from this program.  The Re-employment Assistance Program provides incentives for injured workers to return to work, through the Employer-at-Injury Program (EAIP) and the Preferred Worker Program (PWP). Benefits common to both are wage subsidies, worksite modifications, and employment purchases.  Workers who have not been released to regular work but can return to transitional jobs are eligible for the EAIP. Use of this program allows many claims to remain nondisabling even though the workers have medical restrictions.  Workers who have a permanent disability and are unable to return to regular work are eligible for the PWP benefits, which may be initiated by either the worker or the employer. In addition, claim cost reimbursement is paid for preferred workers who suffer new injuries.  The data in this table include estimated figures and are subject to revision.

The data provided is the number of FED-ED (Federal Funding for Extended Unemployment) and EUC (Emergency Unemployment Compensation) Tier IV Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims that have exhausted.\u00a0 Based on the current legislation, claimants can have either an EUC Tier IV or FED-ED claim as their last available benefit option.  The data is representative of those claims that were processed during the month and does not necessarily represent the month the final payment was made in.  For example, if a claimant is entitled to benefits for the week-ending October 31, 2009, the claim might not get processed until early November and that count would display in the November data.  There are a small percentage of claimants that could go back onto a training extension even after exhausting their FED-ED claim.                  \u2219 The data by county represents the mailing address given by the claimant at the time of filing for UI.\u00a0 It is possible that an individual can reside in a different county than their mailing address.\u00a0 Also, this information does not represent the county where the individual worked.\u00a0 It is also possible that a claimant could have moved or changed their mailing address after filing for UI, which would not be reflected here.                      \u2219 Data for claimants residing outside of California but collecting benefits are not included in these figures nor are invalid addresses in California where a county cannot be determined.                                \u2219 California began paying FED-ED benefits in May 2009, with payments retroactive to February 2009 and began paying EUC Tier IV benefits in February 2010, with payments retroactive to December 2009.  Currently, FED-ED or EUC Tier IV are the last extended benefit programs available to claimants.                         \u2219 Claimants who had a FED-ED extension filed with an effective date of November 22, 2009, or before, will continue to be paid FED-ED extended benefits until they exhaust those FED-ED extensions, before filing for the additional EUC Tiers (which includes EUC Tier IV).  Due to the complexity of the extended benefits legislation, a claimant could have exhausted an EUC Tier IV claim and still be eligible for FED-ED benefits, or vice versa.  Therefore, to capture any claimants that have exhausted all available benefits a query is run to look for those claimants who have exhausted EUC Tier IV and  FED-ED.                                 \u2219 Data for May 2010 through December 2010 have been revised on March 2011.               \u2219 Data for August 2013 through October 2013 have been revised on December 23, 2013.. claimants-exhausted-benefits;exhausted-claims-by-county;fed-ed-bx-by-county;."}, {"text": "Benefits Paid By County (All Programs). \u2219 The data provided is the amount of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits paid to claimants.\u00a0            \u2219 The data by county represents the mailing address given by the claimant at the time of filing for UI.\u00a0 It is possible that an individual can reside in a different county than their mailing address.\u00a0 Also, this information does not represent the county where the individual worked.\u00a0 It is also possible that a claimant could have moved or changed their mailing address after filing for UI which would not be reflected here.

These benefits include benefits for temporary disability (time loss), permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, and death. Statute sets eligibility criteria and the rates at which insurers pay these benefits. In the case of death from work-related causes, indemnity benefits are paid to survivors. Indemnity benefits also include vocational assistance benefits paid on behalf of severely disabled workers to get them back to work.    Indemnity benefits also include settlements between workers and insurers. Claim disposition agreements (CDAs) and disputed claim settlements (DCSs) are the two forms of settlements.    The Workers' Benefit Fund ( WBF)provides funds for programs that assist employers and injured workers. Assessment revenues, not insurance premiums, finance these programs. Employers and workers each pay half the assessment. The two major programs are the Retroactive Program and the Re-employment Assistance Program.    The Retroactive Program pays cost-of-living increases to workers or their beneficiaries based on changes in average wages. The two major benefits paid are for permanent total disability and death. Since at least 1995, the majority of PTD and death benefits have been paid from this program.    The Re-employment Assistance Program provides incentives for injured workers to return to work, through the Employer-at-Injury Program (EAIP) and the Preferred Worker Program (PWP). Benefits common to both are wage subsidies, worksite modifications, and employment purchases.    Workers who have not been released to regular work but can return to transitional jobs are eligible for the EAIP. Use of this program allows many claims to remain nondisabling even though the workers have medical restrictions.    Workers who have a permanent disability and are unable to return to regular work are eligible for the PWP benefits, which may be initiated by either the worker or the employer. In addition, claim cost reimbursement is paid for preferred workers who suffer new injuries.    The data in this table include estimated figures and are subject to revision.

Many incidents identified as human trafficking by police are not processed as such in courts. Other Canadian research suggests that charges of human trafficking may not be pursued as such once they come before the courts. Criminal court cases involving human trafficking, on average, involved more charges, took longer to complete, and were less likely to result in a guilty decision when compared with criminal court cases for other violent offences. The added complexity and lower likelihood of successful prosecution of human trafficking cases may influence the decision to pursue charges from the outset of a court case.  https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/200623/dq200623b-eng.pdf?st=HmJC1Imu / De nombreux incidents identifi\u00e9s comme traite d'\u00eatres humains par la police ne sont pas trait\u00e9s comme tels devant les tribunaux.

Alternative Fuels Data Center - Overview of tail pipe emissions from hybrid vehicles nationally, by state    __Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles__    Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do. When measuring well-to-wheel emissions, the electricity source is important: for PHEVs and EVs, part or all of the power provided by the battery comes from off-board sources of electricity. There are emissions associated with the majority of electricity production in the United States.    __Electricity Sources and Emissions__    EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have a well-to-wheel emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional fossil fuels for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a well-to-wheel emissions benefit.    __Direct and Well-to-Wheel Emissions__    Vehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a direct basis and a well-to-wheel basis.    Direct emissions are emitted through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. EVs produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. And when using the internal combustion engine, PHEVs also produce tailpipe emissions. However, their direct emissions are typically lower than those of comparable conventional vehicles.    Well-to-wheel emissions include all emissions related to fuel production, processing, distribution, and use. In the case of gasoline, emissions are produced while extracting petroleum from the earth, refining it, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning it in vehicles. In the case of electricity, most electric power plants produce emissions, and there are additional emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and distribution of the primary energy sources they use for electricity production.

Child well-being matters for both ethical and economic reasons as children who flourish in the early years are more likely to become healthy, productive citizens later in life. This year\u2019s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development\u2014physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional\u2014 does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences.

The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora, which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the \"trivial\" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present, there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires, corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires, written in more than 240 different dialects, for a total of more than 54,000 sentences and more than 40,000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system..

The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora, which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the \"trivial\" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present, there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires, corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires, written in more than 240 different dialects, for a total of more than 54,000 sentences and more than 40,000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system..

The linguistics community is building a metadata-based infrastructure for the description of its research data and tools. At its core is the ISOcat registry ISOcat.org, a collaborative platform to hold a (to be standardized) set of data catgories (i.e., field descriptors). Descriptors have definitions in natural language and little explicit interrelations. With the registry growing to many hundred entries, authored by many, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the rather informal definitions and their glossary-like design make it hard for users to grasp, exploit and manage the registry\u2019s content. Here we take a large subset of the ISOcat term set and reconstruct from it a tree structure following the footsteps of schema.org. Our ontological re-engineering yields a representation that gives users a hierarchical view of linguistic, metadata-related terminology. The new representation adds to the precision of all definitions by making explicit information which is only implicitly given in the ISOcat registry. It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set. The new representation can serve as a complement to the existing ISOcat model, providing additional support for authors and users in browsing, (re-)using, maintaining, and further extending the community\u2019s terminological metadata repertoire.    The set of data categories has been taken from the TDG Metadata of the ISOcat data category registry. As the ISOcat registry changes over time, we give a snapshot of all data in this RDF representation, as generated automatically from the registry's export functionality in Dec 2011. Note that this data is a flat representation of the TDG Metadata entries. Each entry is only represented in RDF with its mnemonic identifier, name, persistent identifier and natural language definition. No other information, in particular, no structural information is given.  (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/nalida/en/docu/isocat-hierarchy.html)    Free for academic and research use.

The linguistics community is building a metadata-based infrastructure for the description of its research data and tools. At its core is the ISOcat registry ISOcat.org, a collaborative platform to hold a (to be standardized) set of data catgories (i.e., field descriptors). Descriptors have definitions in natural language and little explicit interrelations. With the registry growing to many hundred entries, authored by many, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the rather informal definitions and their glossary-like design make it hard for users to grasp, exploit and manage the registry\u2019s content. Here we take a large subset of the ISOcat term set and reconstruct from it a tree structure following the footsteps of schema.org. Our ontological re-engineering yields a representation that gives users a hierarchical view of linguistic, metadata-related terminology. The new representation adds to the precision of all definitions by making explicit information which is only implicitly given in the ISOcat registry. It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set. The new representation can serve as a complement to the existing ISOcat model, providing additional support for authors and users in browsing, (re-)using, maintaining, and further extending the community\u2019s terminological metadata repertoire.    The set of data categories has been taken from the TDG Metadata of the ISOcat data category registry. As the ISOcat registry changes over time, we give a snapshot of all data in this RDF representation, as generated automatically from the registry's export functionality in Dec 2011. Note that this data is a flat representation of the TDG Metadata entries. Each entry is only represented in RDF with its mnemonic identifier, name, persistent identifier and natural language definition. No other information, in particular, no structural information is given.  (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/nalida/en/docu/isocat-hierarchy.html)    Free for academic and research use.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Transit Ridership (T11)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Daily transit boardings    LAST UPDATED  May 2017    DESCRIPTION  Transit ridership refers to the number of passenger boardings on public transportation, which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.    DATA SOURCE  Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database  http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  The NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.    2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.. transportation;economy;health;vital signs.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR Transit Asset Condition (T19)  FULL MEASURE NAME Percentage of transit assets that have fallen out of a state of good repair  LAST UPDATED September 2018  DESCRIPTION Transit asset condition reflects the relative age of the region\u2019s transit infrastructure, as dictated by federally mandated performance measures. Vehicle condition (both for revenue and non-revenue vehicles) is measured by the vehicle\u2019s age relative to its specified useful life. Condition of guideway is measured by the share of miles that have speed restrictions due to aging infrastructure. Condition of passenger and maintenance facilities is measured by the share of facilities with a condition rating below fair, weighted by the monetary value of the facility.      DATA SOURCE Metropolitan Transportation Commission: Regional Transit Capital Inventory (RTCI)  CONTACT INFORMATION vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov  METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) Condition of revenue vehicles and non-revenue vehicles is evaluated based on the Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) specified by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Useful Life Benchmarks represent the estimated number of years that a vehicle can be in service and still be in a state of good repair, weighing the cost of maintenance against the cost of replacement. ULBs range from 8 years for automobiles and vans to 42 years for ferry boats.    Condition of guideway, or rail tracks, is defined as the percentage of directional route-miles with performance restrictions observed at 9:00AM on the first Wednesday of each month. Performance restrictions are defined as a speed limit on a segment of fixed guideway that is below the guideway\u2019s design speed, and can result from a number of causes, including defects, signaling issues, or obstruction due to construction or maintenance activities.  Condition of facilities is evaluated based on a five point condition rating scale developed by the FTA, known as Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM). Facilities with a condition rating of one or two are deemed to be out of a state of good repair. Facilities are evaluated based on a minimum of 10 criteria, including electrical systems, plumbing, interiors, and exteriors. Facility condition is weighted by assessed monetary value of the asset.

Child well-being matters for both ethical and economic reasons as children who flourish in the early years are more likely to become healthy, productive citizens later in life. This year\u2019s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development\u2014physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional\u2014 does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children\u2019s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.      <br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/sg6f-m5te </b></br></br>. politics;education;early childhood; child welfare; child development; early childhood education.

The following 34 \"investment packages\" were derived from recommendations in Corridor Mobility Plans for the nine corridors eligible for 2016 Mobility Bond construction funding in accordance with the ballot language approved by voters in November 2016. Those corridors are: North Lamar Boulevard, Burnet Road, Airport Boulevard, East MLK Jr. Boulevard/FM969, South Lamar Boulevard, East Riverside Drive, Guadalupe Street, William Cannon Drive and Slaughter Lane. The investment packages below equal an estimated $1.4 billion in mobility, safety, and connectivity improvements across the nine corridoes. The packages underwent a comparative analysis to identify the packages that would result in the biggest bang for the buck.     The packages were divided into two improvement categories: Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements and Enhanced Multimodal Improvements. Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements generally include the \u2018short-term\u2019 recommendations from the Corridor Mobility Plans. These provide improvements across all modes along the entire length of the corridors, including pavement rehabilitation, intersection improvements, traffic signal upgrades, transit signal priority, better connections to transit stops, continuous ADA-compliant sidewalks along the length of the corridor, continuous bicycle lanes or shared-use paths along the length of the corridors, and in some cases intermittent median islands for safety. Enhanced Multimodal Improvements generally include the \u2018long-term\u2019 recommendations from the Corridor Mobility Plans. While each corridor is different, and the specific improvements may vary, the Enhanced Multimodal Improvements are intended to bring each corridor up to the ultimate vision established in the Corridor Mobility Plan. These improvements build upon the Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements and add full street reconstruction, wider sidewalks, protected bicycle lanes, intermittent median islands for safety, and streetscape improvements, such as landscaping and trees.    Each package has three estimated costs: low, most likely, and high. The low represents the upper limit of the cost with a 10% confidence level, the most likely a 70% confidence level, and the high a 90% confidence level. This range is due to the level of information we have right now, and is typical of infrastructure project development.     City of Austin staff is proposing three approaches to funding the estimated $1.4 billion in projects: Full design and construction, Initiate Design and Possible Construction, Seek Additional Funding Opportunities. Full design and construction: Investment package will be fully funded through 2016 Mobility Bond funding and other partnership/coordination opportunities. Initiate design and possible construction: The City will start design of improvements in the investment package and the City will be seek funding and partnership opportunities to fund the project through completion. Seek additional funding opportunities: The City will seek to implement the improvements through partnership/coordination opportunities, and will seek additional funding opportunities.    All recommendations are approximate, proposed, and subject to change. The exact locations of improvements will be determined in the Project Design Phase, and the City will work with the community prior to project construction.. infrastructure;transportation;housing & development;corridors;pavement rehabilitation;traffic signals;bicycle projects;sidewalk projects;road projects;corridor construction program;2016 bond;2016 mobility bond. saradanae."}, {"text": "LinkNYC Kiosk Status (Archived).

NOAA data of sea level trends.  These are local mean sea level trends, displayed on a map.    The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise (EN11)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Share of population living in zones at risk from various sea level rise forecast scenarios    LAST UPDATED  July 2017    DESCRIPTION  Vulnerability to sea level rise refers to the share of the historical and current Bay Area population located in areas at risk from forecasted sea level rise over the coming decades. Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.        DATA SOURCE  San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission  2017  Sea Level Rise Maps  http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/    U.S. Census Bureau  1990-2010  Decennial Census  http://factfinder2.census.gov    U.S. Census Bureau  2015  American Community Survey  http://factfinder2.census.gov    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  Projected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data.     Because census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.    For the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise (EN11)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Share of population living in zones at risk from various sea level rise forecast scenarios    LAST UPDATED  July 2017    DESCRIPTION  Vulnerability to sea level rise refers to the share of the historical and current Bay Area population located in areas at risk from forecasted sea level rise over the coming decades. Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.     DATA SOURCE  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  2017  Sea Level Rise Maps  https://coast.noaa.gov/slrdata/    U.S. Census Bureau  2015  American Community Survey  http://factfinder.census.gov    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  Projected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data.     Because census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts.

SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)  #Grade 9 not in high schools  ##Indicates how special class is delivered    For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.     The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, \u201ccluster\u201d teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction.

NEW YORK CITY Results on the NEW YORK STATE English Language Arts (ELA) & Mathematics Exams  (Grades 3 - 8)  2013 - 2015  Notes   Starting in 2013, the NY State Education Department (NYSED) changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm    Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for \"matched\" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, \"matched\" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th \u2013 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.  For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.  Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults    In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.

To create the annotation of NEs with URIs, we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First, FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al., 2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards, the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore, the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially, but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

We can only enter the information we receive.  \u2022 Data entry errors \u2013 we now have QA/QC procedures in place to prevent or catch and fix a lot of these.  \u2022 Historically there are multiple records of the same generator.  Each variation in spelling in name or address generated a separate handler record.  We have worked to minimize these but many remain.  The good news is that as long as they all have the same EPA ID they will all show up in your search results.  \u2022 Handlers provide erroneous data to obtain an EPA ID - data entry was based on erroneous information.  Examples include incorrect or bogus addresses and names. There are also a lot of MISSPELLED NAMES AND ADDRESSES!  \u2022 Missing manifests \u2013 Not every required manifest gets submitted to DEEP. Also, of the more than 100,000 paper manifests we receive each year, some were incorrectly handled and never entered.  \u2022 Missing data \u2013 we know that the records for approximately 25 boxes of manifests, mostly prior to 1985 were lost from the database in the 1980\u2019s.   \u2022 Translation errors \u2013 the data has been migrated to newer data platforms numerous times, and each time there have been errors and data losses.  \u2022 Wastes incorrectly entered \u2013 mostly due to complex names that were difficult to spell, or typos in quantities or units of measure.

USAID's Development Credit Authority (DCA) works with investors, local financial institutions, and development organizations to design and deliver investment alternatives that unlock financing for U.S. Government priorities. Whether it's getting working capital to promising entrepreneurs or input financing to small farmers, DCA seeks to prove the commercial viability of underserved markets so that lending and investment continues long after we exit. The Development Credit Authority (DCA) uses partial credit guarantees to mobilize local financing in developing countries. Guarantee agreements encourage private lenders to extend financing to underserved borrowers in new sectors and regions. By opening up local channels of financing, USAID is empowering entrepreneurs in developing countries at a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. This USAID dataset shows the partial credit guarantees that USAID has issued since the development credit authority program was founded in 1999. The spreadsheet reflects the full facility size of each guarantee, how much was lent under the guarantee, the status of the guarantee (i.e., active or expired), how much in claims the bank submitted due to losses it incurred for loans placed under the guarantee, and how many loans were placed under coverage of the guarantee.

To more accurately measure transportation services, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, jointly developed the Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs).

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

Data limitations and factors to consider when using this data:  This data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.  This dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center.

The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year.  The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous.  For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.  (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

Alternative Fuels Data Center - Overview of tail pipe emissions from hybrid vehicles nationally, by state    __Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles__    Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do. When measuring well-to-wheel emissions, the electricity source is important: for PHEVs and EVs, part or all of the power provided by the battery comes from off-board sources of electricity. There are emissions associated with the majority of electricity production in the United States.    __Electricity Sources and Emissions__    EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have a well-to-wheel emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional fossil fuels for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a well-to-wheel emissions benefit.    __Direct and Well-to-Wheel Emissions__    Vehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a direct basis and a well-to-wheel basis.    Direct emissions are emitted through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. EVs produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. And when using the internal combustion engine, PHEVs also produce tailpipe emissions. However, their direct emissions are typically lower than those of comparable conventional vehicles.    Well-to-wheel emissions include all emissions related to fuel production, processing, distribution, and use. In the case of gasoline, emissions are produced while extracting petroleum from the earth, refining it, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning it in vehicles. In the case of electricity, most electric power plants produce emissions, and there are additional emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and distribution of the primary energy sources they use for electricity production.

Central Cities and Other Parts of Metropolitan Areas (i) A census tract with median income at or below 120 percent of the median income of the metropolitan area (MSA) and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A census tract with median income at or below 90 percent of median income of the MSA. b. Nonmetropolitan Areas (i) A census tract with median income at or below 120 percent of the greater of the State nonmetropolitan median income or the nationwide nonmetropolitan median income and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A census tract with median income at or below 95 percent of the greater of the State nonmetropolitan median income or the nationwide nonmetropolitan median income. c. Tribal Lands in Metropolitan Areas (i) A Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land with a median income at or below 120 percent of the median income of the MSA and a minority population of 30 percent or greater; or (ii) A Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land with a median income at or below 90 percent of median income of the MSA. d.

Tribal Lands that Cross Metropolitan / Nonmetropolitan Area and/or State Boundaries For certain Federal or State American Indian reservations or tribal or individual trust lands, the tribal area crosses an MSA or state boundary. In these cases, the median incomes of the MSA or MSAs, the nonmetropolitan area of the state or states, or the nationwide nonmetropolitan area that applies to the tract containing the tribal area determines whether the part of the Federal or State American Indian reservation or tribal or individual trust land is underserved. METHODOLOGY: Whether a tract has 30 percent or more minority population is determined by rounding 30 percent of the tracts population to the nearest person, and comparing this to the count of minority persons in the area. The applicable percentage of area median income and whether the tracts median income is below it is determined by rounding the applicable percentage of area median income to the nearest dollar and comparing this to tract median family income.

In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc.     Data users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income.   Census also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity.   These alternative measures are derived from information collected in Census surveys along with information from other agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average. Income breakdown data is only provided for one year as it is not possible to compare consistent inflation-adjusted income brackets over time given Census data limitations.. health;housing & development;demographics.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019.  For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.  Population estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year.

This dataset supports measure S.D.4.b, S.D.6 of SD23. The Downtown Austin Community Court (DACC) was established to address quality of life and public order offenses occurring in the downtown Austin area utilizing a restorative justice court model.  DACC offers alternatives to fines and fees for defendants to handle their cases such as community service restitution and participation in rehabilitation services.  Defendants who reside outside of a 40-mile radius from DACC are offered an opportunity to handle their case through correspondence action, meaning the entire judicial process can be handled through email or postal mail.  Correspondence action eliminates an undue burden requiring a defendant to travel back to Austin to appear for their case and it allows for quicker access to court services of Austin residents by reducing the number of individuals required to appear for their case.  This  measure tracks how many cases involving non-homeless individuals have been handled through correspondence action recorded in the court's case management system.  The data source for number and percentage of instances where people access court services other than in person for DACC has a annual range based on fiscal year 2015- first quarter fiscal year 2020.

The Motor Vehicle Collisions person table contains details for people involved in the crash. Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.  </p>  The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.  </p>  Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data warehouse.

For the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Regional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties\u2019 modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \u201cTransit\u201d includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables.

Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   Former English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years.

The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment. \u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/ \u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information. \u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.  WHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF? The Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal:  \u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500); \u2022 larger display of search returns; \u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and \u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format) \u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images.  The main advantages of the Portal are: \u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and \u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time.   WHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA? All hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including: \u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment \u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed) \u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number) \u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator \u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018. \u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting.   All other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.  They were discarded after 2 years in accord with DEEP records retention schedule.

Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.  Examples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected.   Data limitations and factors to consider when using this data:  This data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.  This dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center.   For a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .

Gross domestic product (GDP) is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within Iowa in a particular period of time. In concept, an industry's GDP by state, referred to as its \"value added\", is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus its intermediate inputs (consumption of goods and services purchased from other U.S. industries or imported).

With respect to activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, at least 51 percent of the activity's beneficiaries must be low and moderate income. For CDBG, a person is considered to be of low income only if he or she is a member of a household whose income would qualify as \\\"very low income\\\" under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program. Generally, these Section 8 limits are based on 50% of area median. Similarly, CDBG moderate income relies on Section 8 \\\"lower income\\\" limits, which are generally tied to 80% of area median.

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

In this study, livestock were vaccinated intradermally with 5 log10 pfu of MP-121-NSm-del Rift Valley fever live, attenuated vaccine using the Bioject Zetajet developmental device.  Neutralizing antibody titers (expressed as a reciprocal) were determined by the 80% Plaque Reduction Neutralization technique (PRNT-80) at days post vaccination (DPV).     The overall purpose of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Rift Valley Fever Control in Agriculture is to increase the food supply by developing and applying a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever disease among livestock in Africa.  Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that continues to have a devastating impact on human and animal health in Africa.  Since the discovery of RVF as the cause of an outbreak among sheep and humans during the early 1930s in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the disease has emerged as one of the most important zoonoses in Africa. The disease has and continues to affect the health of thousands to millions of humans and animals, and the livestock industry has lost millions of dollars, and therefore, affecting hundreds of millions of those whose livelihood depends on livestock, exaggerating poverty on already deprived communities.    The specific aim of the Lab is to conduct a 5 year research project to develop and evaluate a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever (RVF) among livestock in Tanzania and other RVF virus enzootic African regions and thereby improve food security, nutrition and livelihoods in Africa as a USAID priority under Feed the Future, the U.S. Government\u2019s global hunger and food security initiative.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.<br /> The Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.</p> <p>As part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete.</p> <p>CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program<br /> On March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.</p> <p>Since expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments.

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.    Potentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.    Not all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.    Mortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.    Underlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)    Heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20\u2013I51)  Cancer (C00\u2013C97)  Unintentional injury (V01\u2013X59 and Y85\u2013Y86)  Chronic lower respiratory disease (J40\u2013J47)  Stroke (I60\u2013I69)  Locality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2013 county-based classification scheme.    Benchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.    Potentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.    Users can explore three benchmarks:    \u201c2010 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.  \u201c2005 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.  \u201cFloating\u201d is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.

With respect to activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, at least 51 percent of the activity's beneficiaries must be low and moderate income. For CDBG, a person is considered to be of low income only if he or she is a member of a household whose income would qualify as \\\"very low income\\\" under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program. Generally, these Section 8 limits are based on 50% of area median. Similarly, CDBG moderate income relies on Section 8 \\\"lower income\\\" limits, which are generally tied to 80% of area median.

A shapefile of 311 undersea features from all major oceans and seas has been created as an aid for retrieving georeferenced information resources.

The geographic extent of the data set is 0 degrees E to 0 degrees W longitude and 75 degrees S to 90 degrees N latitude. Many of the undersea features (UF) in the shapefile were selected from a list assembled by Weatherall and Cramer (2008) in a report from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) to the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN). Annex II of the Weatherall and Cramer report (p. 20-22) lists 183 undersea features that \"may need additional points to define their shape\" and includes online links to additional BODC documents providing coordinate pairs sufficient to define detailed linestrings for these features. For the first phase of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) project, Wingfield created polygons for 87 of the undersea features on the BODC list, using the linestrings as guides; the selected features were primarily ridges, rises, trenches, fracture zones, basins, and seamount chains. In the second phase of the USGS project, Wingfield and Hartwell created polygons for an additional 224 undersea features, mostly basins, abyssal plains, and fracture zones.

The geographic extent of the data set is 0 degrees E to 0 degrees W longitude and 75 degrees S to 90 degrees N latitude. Many of the undersea features (UF) in the shapefile were selected from a list assembled by Weatherall and Cramer (2008) in a report from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) to the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN). Annex II of the Weatherall and Cramer report (p. 20-22) lists 183 undersea features that \"may need additional points to define their shape\" and includes online links to additional BODC documents providing coordinate pairs sufficient to define detailed linestrings for these features. For the first phase of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) project, Wingfield created polygons for 87 of the undersea features on the BODC list, using the linestrings as guides; the selected features were primarily ridges, rises, trenches, fracture zones, basins, and seamount chains. In the second phase of the USGS project, Wingfield and Hartwell created polygons for an additional 224 undersea features, mostly basins, abyssal plains, and fracture zones.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR Jobs (LU2)  FULL MEASURE NAME Employment estimates by place of work  LAST UPDATED March 2020   DESCRIPTION Jobs refers to the number of employees in a given area by place of work. These estimates do not include self-employed and private household employees.  DATA SOURCE California Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics 1990-2018 http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/  U.S. Census Bureau: LODES Data Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program (2005-2010) http://lehd.ces.census.gov/  U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, Tables S0804 (2010) and B08604 (2010-2017) https://factfinder.census.gov/  Bureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics Table D-3: Employees on nonfarm payrolls (1990-2018) http://www.bls.gov/data/  METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) The California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment, by place of employment, for California counties. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from monthly estimates and thus reflect \u201cannual average employment.\u201d Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.  For measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.  The following incorporated cities and towns are included in each sub-county area: North Alameda County \u2013 Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont East Alameda County - Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton South Alameda County - Fremont, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, Union City Central Contra Costa County - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek East Contra Costa County - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg West Contra Costa County - El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, San Pablo Marin \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns Napa \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns San Francisco \u2013 San Francisco North San Mateo - Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Millbrae, Pacifica, San Bruno, South San Francisco Central San Mateo - Belmont, Burlingame, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, San Carlos, San Mateo South San Mateo - East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside North Santa Clara - Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale San Jose \u2013 San Jose Southwest Santa Clara - Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga South Santa Clara - Gilroy, Morgan Hill East Solano - Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville South Solano - Benicia, Vallejo North Sonoma - Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor South Sonoma - Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma. economy;health;demographics;vital signs.

DATA SOURCES    U.S. Census Bureau  1960-1990  Decennial Census  http://factfinder2.census.gov    California Department of Finance  1961-2016  Population and Housing Estimates  http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  All legal boundaries and names for Census geography (metropolitan statistical area, county, city, tract) are as of January 1, 2010, released beginning November 30, 2010 by the U.S. Census Bureau. A priority development area (PDA) is a locally-designated infill area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are as current as July 2016. Population estimates for PDAs were derived from Census population counts at the block group level for 2000-2014 and at the tract level for 1970-1990.     Population estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average.         Estimates of density for tracts and PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.     Annual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from monthly estimates and thus reflect \u201cannual average employment.\u201d Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.  For measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.

The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher.

Larger geographies (metro and county) rely upon ACS 1-year data, while smaller geographies rely upon ACS 5-year rolling average data. 1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed by ABAG staff as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.  Inflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

For reporting from July 1 2017, the Territory will be including date invoice received in the notifiable invoices register.\u00a0 A number of points should be taken into account when using this information:      - For the June 2017 reporting period, this field is the date that a valid invoice was received by the responsible Territory entity, however in small number of cases, it relates to the date the invoices was initially entered into the financial processing system of the Territory entity where known.      - A small proportion of notifiable invoices do not have date received information recorded.\u00a0 This is due to a variety of reasons including some cases of scheduled payments under agreements or contracts not having an explicit invoice received date, and several reporting entities not yet being able to transmit to the Territory central finance system the date invoice received.. finance;health.

The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).

This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.<br /> The Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.</p> <p>As part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete.</p> <p>CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program<br /> On March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.</p> <p>Since expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments.

These are local mean sea level trends, displayed on a map.    The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment. \u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/ \u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information. \u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.  WHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF? The Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal:  \u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500); \u2022 larger display of search returns; \u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and \u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format) \u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images.  The main advantages of the Portal are: \u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and \u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time.   WHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA? All hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including: \u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment \u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed) \u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number) \u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator \u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018. \u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting.   All other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.  They were discarded after 2 years in accord with DEEP records retention schedule.  Non-hazardous manifests include: \u2022 Manifests with only non-RCRA hazardous waste listed \u2022 Manifests from generators that did not have a permanent or temporary Generator ID number \u2022 Sometimes non-hazardous manifests were considered \u201cHazar. generator;hazardous-waste;manifest;rcra;shipment;shipped;waste;."}, {"text": "Solid Waste Management Facilities.

The Program provides a free and convenient means for residents to manage their HHW by conducting weekly collection events throughout the County. In late 2002, the Program was expanded to include the collection of electronic waste (E Waste - e.g., televisions, computers, cell phones, etc.). The Program serves all 88 cities and the unincorporated communities in the County.

The availability of valid, comparable, and standardized public debt data is essential for the implementation of sound policies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This is why at the core of the LAC Debt Group initiative is the development of a standardized sovereign debt database to help debt managers, policy makers, and other actors of financial markets analyze the evolution and composition of public debt in LAC and conduct cross-country comparisons. The information of the database is provided by the public debt offices of LAC countries in response to a questionnaire specifically designed to allow comparability of data. The questionnaire, whose response is non-compulsory, is intended to compile up-to-date standardized statistics for objective and homogeneous definitions of public debt.

The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year.  The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous.  For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.  (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction.

The following are true for both the public use dataset and the restricted access dataset:  - Data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at <a href=\"www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf\">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf</a>.  - Data are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.  - Data are suppressed to protect individual privacy.  - The datasets include all cases with an initial report date of case to CDC at least 14 days prior to the creation of the previously updated datasets. This 14-day lag will allow case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.  - Datasets are updated monthly.   - Both datasets are created using CDC\u2019s operational Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access and include protections designed to protect individual privacy.  - For more information about data collection and reporting, please see <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html\">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html</a>  - For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a>  Overview  The COVID-19 case surveillance system database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and states.

The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.

This report provides a weekly summary of deaths with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by select geographic and demographic variables. In this release, counts of deaths are provided by the race and Hispanic origin of the decedent. Topics will be added to the release as they become available.  These provisional counts are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. Data shown on this page may be incomplete and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Data on this page are revised weekly and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1\u20132 weeks.  Weighted population distributions more accurately reflect race/ethnic distributions of the geographic locations where COVID outbreaks are occurring (see below for the methods used to calculate weighted percentages). The weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. See Table 2 below for unweighted populations.  Estimated distributions of COVID-19 deaths and population size by race and Hispanic origin  The percentages of COVID-19 deaths by race and Hispanic origin were calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths for each race and Hispanic origin group by the total number of COVID-19 deaths. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. The distribution of deaths involving COVID-19 by race/ethnicity should not be compared to the race/ethnicity distribution of the U.S. population because COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain geographic locations where the racial and ethnic population distribution differs from that of the United States overall. Additionally, COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain areas within states, and it is therefore not appropriate to compare the percent of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity to the racial/ethnic population distribution of a given state.  To make the estimated population distribution more comparable to the geographic areas where COVID-19 deaths are occurring, weighted population distributions are provided in this report. The weighted population distributions were calculated as follows. County-level population counts by race and Hispanic origin were multiplied by the corresponding total count of COVID-19 deaths by county (of residence). These weighted counts were then summed to the state (or national) level. The percentage of the population within each race and Hispanic origin group by state (or for the U.S.) was then estimated using these weighted counts. Counties with no COVID-19 deaths received a weight of zero, and thus do not contribute to the weighted population totals. Population counts for counties with large numbers of COVID-19 deaths are upweighted proportional to their numbers of COVID-19 deaths. These weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. For example, assume that 75% of the total number of COVID deaths occurred in a single county, County X, while the other 25% of COVID deaths occurred in County Y, and all other counties reported zero deaths. The weighted population counts for County X would contribute 75% of the total population counts, while the population counts for Count. coronavirus;covid-19;deaths;ethnicity;mortality;nchs;population;race;state;united-states;."}, {"text": "VSRR - State and National Provisional Counts for Live Births, Deaths, and Infant Deaths.

National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified that have been received and coded. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks.</p> <p>The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), and pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19; (a) by week ending date, (b) by age at death, and (c) by specific jurisdictions. Future updates to this release may include additional detail such as demographic characteristics (e.g., sex), additional causes of death (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome or other comorbidities), or estimates based on models that account for reporting delays to generate more accurate predicted provisional counts.</p> <p>Pneumonia deaths are included to provide context for understanding the completeness of COVID-19 mortality data and related trends. Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition. Thus, increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality. Additionally, estimates of completeness for pneumonia deaths may provide context for understanding the lag in reporting for COVID-19 deaths, as it is anticipated that these causes would have similar delays in reporting, processing, and coding. However, it is possible that reporting of COVID-19 mortality may be slower or faster than for other causes of death, and that the delay may change over time. Analyses to better understand and quantify reporting delays for COVID-19 deaths and related causes are underway. The list of causes provided in these tables may expand in future releases as more data are received, and other potentially comorbid conditions are determined.</p> <p>Technical notes</p> <p>Comparing data in this report to other sources</p> <p>Provisional death counts in this report will not match counts in other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Death data, once received and processed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), are tabulated by the state or jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent\u2019s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems.  Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cause.  Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths.  This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources. Provisional counts reported here track approximately 1\u20132 weeks behind other published data sources on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (1,2,3).</p> <p>Nature and sources of data</p> <p>Provisional death c</p> . age;coronavirus;covid-19;deaths;mortality;nchs;pneumonia;state;united-states;."}, {"text": "Purchase Order Quantity Price detail for Commodity/Goods procurements.

Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts.

The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

Prior to the TSAs, the magnitude of transportation services had long been underestimated, as most national measures counted only the value of for-hire services. Measurement of services provided only by for-hire firms misses the sizable contribution of transportation services that take place within nontransportation industries, termed as in-house transportation.    To more accurately measure transportation services, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, jointly developed the Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs). The TSAs, as a supplement to the U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, measure the contribution of both for-hire and in-house transportation.

In this manuscript, we synthesize current and legacy data from multiple studies to better understand the distribution and diversity of soil types and their properties in the Plateau physiographic region of the West Usamabara Mountains in Northeastern Tanzania. Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 \u2013 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were  identified as the most likely limiting nutrients in West Usambaran plateau soils in general. This information is critical for sustainable land management which will be applicable to the soils of other mountain complexes in the Eastern Arc chain.. finance;economy;landscape position;tanzania;total;bray p;exchangeable k;tn;cation exchange capacity;acrisols;ultisols;land use;elevation;ph;soc;west usambara mountains.

SUMMARY</strong> Medical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.  Cases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.  Dataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to March 2nd, 2020 when testing began. It is updated daily.  Geographic areas summarized are: 1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a> 2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a> 3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> Addresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2018 ACS estimates for population provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to ([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> Geographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset each day.  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Privacy rules in effect</em> To protect privacy, certain rules are in effect: 1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values 2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values 3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000  <em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em> Rates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.  <em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em> ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.  <em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em> A single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality. While some cases cannot be mapped to sub-areas like Census Tracts, ongoing data quality efforts result in improved mapping on a rolling bases.. ."}, {"text": "Miles Of Streets.

Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.  Examples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected.   Data limitations and factors to consider when using this data:  This data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.  This dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center.   For a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .

JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names (called 'entities') developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).  The resource is the by-product of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM, see http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html ) family of applications, which has been analysing up to 220,000 news reports per day, since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.  JRC-Names has been available for download since September 2011, consisting of name variant lists and accompanying software. The new linked data edition, accessible through the European Union's Open Data Portal, offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool, including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.  INFORMATION ON JRC-NAMES DATA MODEL  The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies, see http://lemon-model.net/ ), a model which allows the expression of lexical information relative to ontologies.  JRC entities are modeled as instances of DBpedia classes (dbpedia:Person and dbpedia:Organisation) and the multilingual lexicalizations of their names and function names are represented as Lexical Entries of lemon Lexicons. Various other types of (linguistic) information and metadata are expressed using standardized vocabularies (LexInfo, OLiA, ISOCat, Lexvo, DCTerms, etc.). For cases where no already existing vocabulary could appropriately answer the needs, in-house classes and properties were defined ( see resource JRC data model for JRC names). The 'JRC-Names schema' gives an overview of how JRC-Names data is modeled.  JRC-Names has links towards the following datasets: DBpedia ( http://dbpedia.org/ ), New York Times Open Data ( http://data.nytimes.com/ ) and Talk of Europe ( http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl ).

Child Protective Investigations (CPI) conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR).  Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety.  Completed investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim. Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases. A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the CPS glossary.   At the end of a completed investigation, CPI assesses child safety, the risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future, the ability of the family to reduce the risk without CPI intervention, the ability of CPI to provide needed services and other circumstances in the case to decide whether to provide ongoing services.   The Case Action Family Substitute Care includes investigations that resulted in at least one child (not necessarily all children in the home) being removed. Does not equal number of children removed.

It is important to recognize that even areas outside of Natural Landscape Blocks and Essential Connectivity Areas support important ecological values that should not be \"written off\" as lacking conservation value. Furthermore, because the Essential Habitat Connectivity Map was created at the statewide scale, based on available statewide data layers, and ignored Natural Landscape Blocks smaller than 2,000 acres squared, it has errors of omission that should be addressed at regional and local scales.  The Essential Connectivity data represents a statewide network of 850 relatively intact Natural Landscape Blocks (ranging in size from 2,000 to about 3.7 million acres) connected by 192 Essential Connectivity Areas (Table 3.1). There are fewer Essential Connectivity Areas than Natural Landscape Blocks, because each Essential Connectivity Area serves to connect at least two, and as many as 15 Natural Landscape Blocks. Due to the broad, statewide nature of this data, and its focus on connecting very large blocks of mostly protected natural lands, the network omits many areas that are important to biological conservation. The purpose of the map is to focus attention on large areas important to maintaining ecological integrity at the broadest scale. Natural areas excluded from this broad-brush Essential Connectivity Network can therefore not be \"written off\" as unimportant to connectivity conservation or to sustaining California's natural heritage.. infrastructure;environment;transportation;pba50;eir;basis. msmith."}]}, {"question": "energy star markets", "answers": ["Municipal Building Energy Use and Energy Star Score", "ENERGY STAR Certified Commercial Ice Machines", "ENERGY STAR Certified Commercial Dishwashers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Imaging Equipment", "ENERGY STAR Certified Water Coolers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Commercial Water Heaters", "ENERGY STAR Certified Residential Dishwashers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Commercial Boilers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Geothermal Heat Pumps", "ENERGY STAR Certified Boilers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Products - Lighting", "ENERGY STAR Certified Smart Thermostats", "ENERGY STAR Certified Light Commercial HVAC", "Energy Star Certified Homes", "Residential Energy Use", "ENERGY STAR Certified Geothermal Heat Pumps", "ENERGY STAR Certified Furnaces", "ENERGY STAR Certified Water Coolers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Ceiling Fans Light Kits", "Upcoming ENERGY STAR Certified Room Air Conditioners", "ENERGY STAR Certified Residential Clothes Dryers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Enterprise Servers", "ENERGY STAR Certified Commercial Fryers", "Energy Efficiency Peak Demand Reduction", "Energy Efficiency Energy Savings (MWH)"], "positive_ctxs": [{"text": "Municipal Building Energy Use and Energy Star Score.

In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process.   First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.   Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one.

Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.  <em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em> This is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.. economy;public safety;environment;ref:inventory;catalog;open data;inventory.

It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set.

In this manuscript, we synthesize current and legacy data from multiple studies to better understand the distribution and diversity of soil types and their properties in the Plateau physiographic region of the West Usamabara Mountains in Northeastern Tanzania. Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 \u2013 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were  identified as the most likely limiting nutrients in West Usambaran plateau soils in general. This information is critical for sustainable land management which will be applicable to the soils of other mountain complexes in the Eastern Arc chain.. finance;economy;landscape position;tanzania;total;bray p;exchangeable k;tn;cation exchange capacity;acrisols;ultisols;land use;elevation;ph;soc;west usambara mountains.

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.  <strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> The dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> This dataset is collated through 2 ways: 1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published 2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> The dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> <em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em> This dataset has 3 dates: 1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself 2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform 3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date  Note that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process.   First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.   Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.  <em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em> This is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.. catalog;inventory;open-data;ref-inventory;."}, {"text": "Open Data Inspector (ODI) - Datasets.

Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.    All crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. As per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes.

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:      * the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;  * elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.      The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.    Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.

The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora, which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the \"trivial\" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations.

Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public.   Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.  Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.  Deposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.. public safety;politics;law public service program;legislation;justice;law.
