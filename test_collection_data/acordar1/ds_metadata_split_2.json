In particular, we chose 128 articles containing at least one NE. Compared to the News-100 corpus the documents of Reuters-128 are significantly shorter and thus carry a smaller context.    To create the annotation of NEs with URIs, we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First, FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al., 2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards, the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore, the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially, but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases.

This filtered view presents Real Gross Domestic Product for the Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector and subsectors in the State of Iowa by year beginning in 1997.    Gross domestic product (GDP) is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within Iowa in a particular period of time. In concept, an industry's GDP by state, referred to as its \"value added\", is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus its intermediate inputs (consumption of goods and services purchased from other U.S. industries or imported). The Iowa GDP a state counterpart to the Nation's GDP, the Bureau's featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. Iowa GDP differs from national GDP for the following reasons: Iowa GDP excludes and national GDP includes the compensation of federal civilian and military personnel stationed abroad and government consumption of fixed capital for military structures located abroad and for military equipment, except office equipment; and Iowa GDP and national GDP have different revision schedules. GDP is reported in millions of current dollars.    Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure of Iowa's gross product that is based on national prices for the goods and services produced within Iowa. The real estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are measured in millions of chained dollars, but have been multiplied by 1,000,000 to display in dollars for visualization purposes.

The methodology and sectors tracked were third party verified in inventory year 2012. The subsequent inventories are completed according to the guidance of the verifiers. The third-party verification memo for 2010 is available at http://sfenvironment.org/download/2010-community-greenhouse-gas-inventory-3rd-party-verification-memo-march-2013 and for 2012 at http://sfenvironment.org/download/2012-community-greenhouse-gas-inventory-3rd-party-verification-memo-january-2015. In 2015, the City began reporting its emissions to C40 to improve its GHG emissions inventory by using a newer protocol to estimate emissions referred to as the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC). GPC is a framework unifying emissions inventories globally while incorporating new categories to track. San Francisco has been tracking its emissions since 1990; hence, it continues to use the ICLEI USCP. Today, San Francisco continues to disclose emissions under the GPC framework for reporting purposes to and compliance with the Global Covenant of Mayors (GCOM).. environment;transportation;education;sustainability;environment;carbon emissions;san francisco climate action strategy;communitywide;climate change;ghg inventory;greenhouse gas emissions;climate.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend. The University of Colorado's Sea Level Research Group compares global sea level rates calculated by different research organizations and provides detailed explanations about the issues involved.. sea level;sea level changes;tide gauges;. ."

Beneficiary survey data from Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI)    The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implementation of ongoing or future programs. The evaluation sought to identify: 1) implementation challenges, corrective actions to project management, and progress towards achieving expected results; 2) the factors that contributed to the success/failure of the different project components; 3) the effect of the activity on men and women; and 4) the extent to which SEBI contributed to the local social enterprise (SE) policy environment. The evaluation will serve to inform the United States Agency for International Development Jamaica Mission\u2019s (USAID/Jamaica) Local Partner Development (LPD) program under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) as well as the Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA), which is in the process of being registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO), with a view to continuing some of the work of SEBI once the project ends in December 2018. The exact nature of SEJA\u2019s activities is unclear, although the Evaluation Team (ET) understands that the focus could primarily be on incubation services for SEs under the LPD program.    SEBI was initiated by the Jamaica National Foundation (JNF) and jointly funded by JNF and USAID. The rationale for USAID\u2019s decision to support SEBI in Jamaica, implemented by (JNF), was based on several important factors at the time, namely: 1) low levels of business competitiveness and productivity; 2) a stagnant economy; 3) a high debt burden; and 4) high levels of crime in the country. The genesis of SEBI was in JNF\u2019s observation that not-for-profit and other organizations operating in the social sector were struggling to deliver their core services mainly due to a reliance on grants and donations. The underlying goal therefore was to introduce the social enterprise model to these organizations so that they could start generating their own income and become less reliant on grants and donations. SEBI began in July 2012 and is due for completion at the end of December 2018, following three extensions agreed in Modifications 2, 3, and 5 in the Cooperative Agreement (CA).     The ET pursued three separate, yet interlinked, data collection activities that formed the basis of its methodological approach to conducting the SEBI evaluation as follows:  1. Face-to-face meetings on site with SEBI\u2019s incubator and accelerator beneficiary clients as well as representatives from key stakeholders,  including national and local government, the private sector, international community, civil society, NGOs, and business associations and agencies. In total, the ET met with 29 beneficiaries (20 incubators and 13 accelerators) and 30 stakeholders. Team members used semi-structured questionnaires to record answers for later comparative analysis and cross-reference purposes with findings from the other data collection methods, mentioned below.   2. The ET hosted four focus group discussions (FGDs) in the parishes (Trelawny, St. James, Westmoreland and Manchester) and one in Kingston with selected groups of SEBI indirect beneficiaries. In total, 31 participants attended the FGDs, providing views and responses to questions which were noted for later cross-referencing with findings from the direct beneficiary and public awareness surveys.   3. Two surveys were carried out by Market Research Services Limited (MRSL), based in Kingston, on behalf of the ET (see Annex 6 \u2013 Survey Reports for complete analysis of the findings from both surveys).. demographics;health;infrastructure;social;enterprise;boost;initiative;jamaica.

The City of Austin has one of the most generous Customer Assistance Programs in the nation. Utility bill discounts are a key component of the program. They are provided to customers already receiving benefits through a variety of federal, state, county or city assistance programs. In February 2014, the Austin City Council voted to expand the discount program to 45,000 customers a year.  Additionally, in 2015 the Austin City Council voted to no longer have a waitlist as well as include Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers as a qualifier.  Under the program, qualifying Austin Energy customers receive a waiver of the $10 monthly electric customer charge; are exempt from paying the portion of the community benefit charge that supports the Utility Bill Discount Program; and they receive a 10% discount on their kWh usage charge. Austin Water customers also receive a discount on the water/wastewater customer charge as well as a volumetric discount on a customer\u2019s water usage. Watershed Protection provides a 50% discount on the drainage fee. Public Works under a separate qualification waives the transportation user fee.    Customers who qualify for utility bill discounts are receiving an average of $792 per year per family, $248 of which comes from Austin Energy.

This broad and novel database of 52 countries over 2001\u201311, allowed a study that assesses the link between financial intermediation and saving. The study finds that the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region lags well behind other regions in terms of financial depth, as measured by gross private domestic financial assets. LAC countries also have a larger share of bank deposits and cash in the private sector portfolio, compared to non-bank assets (bonds and shares). Moreover, within the institutional investor industry, pension funds are relatively developed in the region, although they grew out of the compulsory pension systems in several countries that date back to the 1980s and 1990s. The findings also indicate that LAC countries have about 40 percent of gross private financial wealth invested abroad, but just 4 percent of gross private liabilities have that origin, which attests to region\u2019s obstacles in tapping international markets. The countries in general present a small share of household and business saving being intermediated through the financial system. In the specific case of bank deposits, just 5 percent of household saving and 3 percent of business saving are kept in the banking system.<br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/idb/dataset/vsdz-m8v5</b></br></br>. housing & development;financial intermediaries; banking system; capital markets; institutional investors; household saving; corporate saving.

The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.. employment;industry;labor-statistics;payroll;."

In particular, we chose 128 articles containing at least one NE. Compared to the News-100 corpus the documents of Reuters-128 are significantly shorter and thus carry a smaller context.    To create the annotation of NEs with URIs, we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First, FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al., 2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards, the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore, the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially, but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases.

The data presented here contains offshore fault geometries, locations, ages, slip rates, and relevant published reference information for the San Francisco Bay Region and its surrounding counties. Metropolitan Transportation Commission staff extracted the data from a statewide feature set provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This polyline feature set has been compiled from previously published mapping where relatively dense, high-resolution marine geophysical data exist.  This compilation represents a significant update to previous national and regional fault datasets, which have been developed without the benefit of new high-resolution datasets. The geodatabase has been designed for easy ingestion by partners including the California Geological Survey and the USGS Quaternary Fault and Fold Database, and to be used to improve seismic hazards products, especially the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps, the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, and the Southern California Earthquake Center Community Fault Model. Other stakeholders include academic scientists, consultants, community planners and managers, the risk assessment community, and the general public.  In the last decade, a number of new marine geophysical datasets collected by the USGS, the Ocean Exploration Trust, and other organizations has led to substantially improved high-resolution mapping of the seafloor in areas including California's mainland State waters and the southern California continental borderland. Data include comprehensive multibeam bathymetry, seismic-reflection, and marine magnetic data in numerous offshore areas. Most of these data have been processed, merged, and released by the USGS in maps, data releases, and journal publications in support of the California Seafloor Mapping Program and the U.S. West Coast and Alaska Marine Geohazards Project. Improved data coverage has allowed researchers to better map offshore faults in areas previously unmapped or covered only by low-resolution data. Additionally, subsurface imaging and seafloor sampling has led to better understanding of fault kinematics and recency of deformation, which are critical for accurately assessing California's seismic and coastal hazards.. transportation;infrastructure;pba50;eir;basis. msmith."

UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

Alternative Fuels Data Center - Overview of tail pipe emissions from hybrid vehicles nationally, by state    __Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles__    Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do. When measuring well-to-wheel emissions, the electricity source is important: for PHEVs and EVs, part or all of the power provided by the battery comes from off-board sources of electricity. There are emissions associated with the majority of electricity production in the United States.    __Electricity Sources and Emissions__    EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have a well-to-wheel emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional fossil fuels for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a well-to-wheel emissions benefit.    __Direct and Well-to-Wheel Emissions__    Vehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a direct basis and a well-to-wheel basis.    Direct emissions are emitted through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. EVs produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. And when using the internal combustion engine, PHEVs also produce tailpipe emissions. However, their direct emissions are typically lower than those of comparable conventional vehicles.    Well-to-wheel emissions include all emissions related to fuel production, processing, distribution, and use. In the case of gasoline, emissions are produced while extracting petroleum from the earth, refining it, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning it in vehicles. In the case of electricity, most electric power plants produce emissions, and there are additional emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and distribution of the primary energy sources they use for electricity production.

The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.  Workers\u2019 compensation indemnity benefits are cash benefits paid to injured workers. These benefits include benefits for temporary disability (time loss), permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, and death. Statute sets eligibility criteria and the rates at which insurers pay these benefits. In the case of death from work-related causes, indemnity benefits are paid to survivors. Indemnity benefits also include vocational assistance benefits paid on behalf of severely disabled workers to get them back to work.  Indemnity benefits also include settlements between workers and insurers. Claim disposition agreements (CDAs) and disputed claim settlements (DCSs) are the two forms of settlements.  The Workers' Benefit Fund ( WBF)provides funds for programs that assist employers and injured workers. Assessment revenues, not insurance premiums, finance these programs. Employers and workers each pay half the assessment. The two major programs are the Retroactive Program and the Re-employment Assistance Program.  The Retroactive Program pays cost-of-living increases to workers or their beneficiaries based on changes in average wages. The two major benefits paid are for permanent total disability and death. Since at least 1995, the majority of PTD and death benefits have been paid from this program.  The Re-employment Assistance Program provides incentives for injured workers to return to work, through the Employer-at-Injury Program (EAIP) and the Preferred Worker Program (PWP). Benefits common to both are wage subsidies, worksite modifications, and employment purchases.  Workers who have not been released to regular work but can return to transitional jobs are eligible for the EAIP. Use of this program allows many claims to remain nondisabling even though the workers have medical restrictions.  Workers who have a permanent disability and are unable to return to regular work are eligible for the PWP benefits, which may be initiated by either the worker or the employer. In addition, claim cost reimbursement is paid for preferred workers who suffer new injuries.  The data in this table include estimated figures and are subject to revision.

The data is representative of those claims that were processed during the month and does not necessarily represent the month the final payment was made in.  For example, if a claimant is entitled to benefits for the week-ending October 31, 2009, the claim might not get processed until early November and that count would display in the November data.  There are a small percentage of claimants that could go back onto a training extension even after exhausting their FED-ED claim.                  \u2219 The data by county represents the mailing address given by the claimant at the time of filing for UI.\u00a0 It is possible that an individual can reside in a different county than their mailing address.\u00a0 Also, this information does not represent the county where the individual worked.\u00a0 It is also possible that a claimant could have moved or changed their mailing address after filing for UI, which would not be reflected here.                      \u2219 Data for claimants residing outside of California but collecting benefits are not included in these figures nor are invalid addresses in California where a county cannot be determined.                                \u2219 California began paying FED-ED benefits in May 2009, with payments retroactive to February 2009 and began paying EUC Tier IV benefits in February 2010, with payments retroactive to December 2009.  Currently, FED-ED or EUC Tier IV are the last extended benefit programs available to claimants.                         \u2219 Claimants who had a FED-ED extension filed with an effective date of November 22, 2009, or before, will continue to be paid FED-ED extended benefits until they exhaust those FED-ED extensions, before filing for the additional EUC Tiers (which includes EUC Tier IV).  Due to the complexity of the extended benefits legislation, a claimant could have exhausted an EUC Tier IV claim and still be eligible for FED-ED benefits, or vice versa.  Therefore, to capture any claimants that have exhausted all available benefits a query is run to look for those claimants who have exhausted EUC Tier IV and  FED-ED.                                 \u2219 Data for May 2010 through December 2010 have been revised on March 2011.               \u2219 Data for August 2013 through October 2013 have been revised on December 23, 2013.. claimants-exhausted-benefits;exhausted-claims-by-county;fed-ed-bx-by-county;."

These benefits include benefits for temporary disability (time loss), permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, and death. Statute sets eligibility criteria and the rates at which insurers pay these benefits. In the case of death from work-related causes, indemnity benefits are paid to survivors. Indemnity benefits also include vocational assistance benefits paid on behalf of severely disabled workers to get them back to work.    Indemnity benefits also include settlements between workers and insurers. Claim disposition agreements (CDAs) and disputed claim settlements (DCSs) are the two forms of settlements.    The Workers' Benefit Fund ( WBF)provides funds for programs that assist employers and injured workers. Assessment revenues, not insurance premiums, finance these programs. Employers and workers each pay half the assessment. The two major programs are the Retroactive Program and the Re-employment Assistance Program.    The Retroactive Program pays cost-of-living increases to workers or their beneficiaries based on changes in average wages. The two major benefits paid are for permanent total disability and death. Since at least 1995, the majority of PTD and death benefits have been paid from this program.    The Re-employment Assistance Program provides incentives for injured workers to return to work, through the Employer-at-Injury Program (EAIP) and the Preferred Worker Program (PWP). Benefits common to both are wage subsidies, worksite modifications, and employment purchases.    Workers who have not been released to regular work but can return to transitional jobs are eligible for the EAIP. Use of this program allows many claims to remain nondisabling even though the workers have medical restrictions.    Workers who have a permanent disability and are unable to return to regular work are eligible for the PWP benefits, which may be initiated by either the worker or the employer.

Many incidents identified as human trafficking by police are not processed as such in courts. Other Canadian research suggests that charges of human trafficking may not be pursued as such once they come before the courts. Criminal court cases involving human trafficking, on average, involved more charges, took longer to complete, and were less likely to result in a guilty decision when compared with criminal court cases for other violent offences. The added complexity and lower likelihood of successful prosecution of human trafficking cases may influence the decision to pursue charges from the outset of a court case.  https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/200623/dq200623b-eng.pdf?st=HmJC1Imu / De nombreux incidents identifi\u00e9s comme traite d'\u00eatres humains par la police ne sont pas trait\u00e9s comme tels devant les tribunaux.

Alternative Fuels Data Center - Overview of tail pipe emissions from hybrid vehicles nationally, by state    __Emissions from Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles__    Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do. When measuring well-to-wheel emissions, the electricity source is important: for PHEVs and EVs, part or all of the power provided by the battery comes from off-board sources of electricity. There are emissions associated with the majority of electricity production in the United States.    __Electricity Sources and Emissions__    EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have a well-to-wheel emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional fossil fuels for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a well-to-wheel emissions benefit.    __Direct and Well-to-Wheel Emissions__    Vehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a direct basis and a well-to-wheel basis.    Direct emissions are emitted through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. EVs produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. And when using the internal combustion engine, PHEVs also produce tailpipe emissions. However, their direct emissions are typically lower than those of comparable conventional vehicles.    Well-to-wheel emissions include all emissions related to fuel production, processing, distribution, and use. In the case of gasoline, emissions are produced while extracting petroleum from the earth, refining it, distributing the fuel to stations, and burning it in vehicles. In the case of electricity, most electric power plants produce emissions, and there are additional emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and distribution of the primary energy sources they use for electricity production.

The CVI Value determines the per-capita concentration of creativity to determine how Austin compares, creatively to the US average and other regions within the US.    The Creative Vitality Index compares the per capita concentration of creative activity in two regions. Data on creative industries, occupations, and cultural nonprofit revenues are indexed using a population-based calculation.

A FEMA housing inspection for renters is used to assess personal property loss and for owners to assess damage to their home as well as personal property. This inspection is done to determine eligibility for FEMA Individual Assistance. For both rental and owner inspections, if the property has flood damage the inspector measures the height of the flooding. They indicate the highest floor of the flooding (for example, Basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor, etc\u2026) and the height of the flooding in that room. In addition for the units without flooding, HUD has estimated minor/major/severe damage based on the damage inspection estimates for real property (owner) and personal property (renter).    This file only presents data on block groups with 10 or more damaged housing units. The suppression to only including 10 or more damaged housing units results in an exclusion of about 6% of the total flooded units. These data reflect Hurricane Sandy damage in the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.

QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice.

The process of child development\u2014physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional\u2014 does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children\u2019s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.      <br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/sg6f-m5te </b></br></br>. politics;education;early childhood; child welfare; child development; early childhood education.

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:      * the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;  * elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.      The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.    Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.    The BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers, it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs, judgements, articles from periodicals, contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.  . bibliographic data;bibliography;country-italy;library;lod;lodlam;rdf;rdf-format;.

The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora, which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the \"trivial\" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present, there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires, corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires, written in more than 240 different dialects, for a total of more than 54,000 sentences and more than 40,000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system..

We surveyed members of the Austin community using a survey developed by the audit team. Survey questions generally asked respondents' opinions on cultural center programs, staff, fees, and facilities. The survey opened January 3 and closed January 27, 2020. Austin community members were invited to take the survey through social media outreach and direct email invitations. The survey and outreach materials were written in English and translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese. A total of 1,330 community members responded to the survey. Respondents were asked only to respond for centers they had visited in the last two years and could respond for more than one center. The comments detailed in this table were in response to open-ended survey items that allowed respondents to give opinions or suggestions about each center's programming, fees, staff, and facilities. Any open-ended responses answered in Spanish, Vietnamese, or Chinese were translated prior to analysis. To gauge the general sentiment of the responses, each was categorized as \"Positive,\" \"Negative,\" \"Suggestion,\" or \"N/A.\" During analysis, some comments were deemed more relevant to other open-ended survey items than the items for which they were originally written.

Secondary \u2014 commercial customers including small to large businesses. This means Austin Energy owns, operates and maintains the equipment supplying power to those facilities .   Secondary 1 \u2014 commercial customers served at less than 10 kW.   Secondary 2 \u2014 commercial customers served between 10 and 50 kW. Secondary 3 \u2014 commercial customers served at more than 50 kW.     Primary \u2014 customers that take service at high voltage and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and expense in serving these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, hightech facilities and data centers typically fall under this level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7.   Primary 1 \u2014 commercial customers served at less than 3 MW.

Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002.    The comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages\u2014full-time, regular wages\u2014part-time or regular wages\u2014civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category.    Personnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages\u2014full-time, regular wages\u2014part-time and regular wages\u2014civil service.

Austin community members were invited to take the survey through social media outreach and direct email invitations. The survey and outreach materials were written in English and translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese. A total of 1,330 community members responded to the survey. Respondents were asked only to respond for centers they had visited in the last two years and could respond for more than one center. The comments detailed in this table were in response to open-ended survey items that allowed respondents to give opinions or suggestions about each center's programming, fees, staff, and facilities. Any open-ended responses answered in Spanish, Vietnamese, or Chinese were translated prior to analysis. To gauge the general sentiment of the responses, each was categorized as \"Positive,\" \"Negative,\" \"Suggestion,\" or \"N/A.\" During analysis, some comments were deemed more relevant to other open-ended survey items than the items for which they were originally written.

(Grades 3 - 8)    Notes   Starting in 2013, the NY State Education Department (NYSED) changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm    Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for \"matched\" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, \"matched\" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th \u2013 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.  For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.  Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults    In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.

See more details on the plan here: https://sf.gov/news/san-francisco-releases-tenderloin-neighborhood-safety-assessment-and-plan-covid-19  <strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> A team of representative City departments from the Healthy Streets Operation Center (Department of Emergency Management, Department of Public Health, Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, Human Rights Commission, San Francisco Police Department, San Francisco Fire Department, and Department of Public Works), SF Homeless Outreach Team, Felton Institute, and community groups and stakeholders was assembled to design and implement a robust Tenderloin Neighborhood Needs Assessment. This assessment was conducted on the morning of April 28, 2020 and consisted of multi-disciplinary teams walking each block of an area of the Tenderloin broken into six geographic zones. These zone locations are shown in the plan, and are mapped in this dataset.  <strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> This is a reference map that will not be updated.  <strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> These zones can be used with other datasets to track trends by zone. Note that these zones are the priority zones for the Tenderloin Plan and do not represent the entire Tenderloin Neighborhood boundary.

Each record contains a link to view the actual imaged document or a link on how to request the document for F1 statements of financial affairs.    The dataset includes both original and amended reports and documents. Data consumers must look at the individual documents to determine if a particular document has been superseded by an amendment. For example, a candidate might file a C4 summary report and file an amendment to the report. There is no indicator on the original C4 that it has been amended. For most documents, amendments have the term \"AMENDED\" as part of the origin field but the original document will not contain any indicator that it has been superseded by an amendment.

NOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively. Also, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed: 1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016. 2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree. NOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged. NOTE: On 1/16/2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year. NOTE: On 1/1/2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year. The most recent address is used.. demographics;town;enrollment counts;gender;dss. Greg Brooks."

DATA SOURCE  Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database  http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  The NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.    2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.. transportation;economy;health;vital signs.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR Transit Asset Condition (T19)  FULL MEASURE NAME Percentage of transit assets that have fallen out of a state of good repair  LAST UPDATED September 2018  DESCRIPTION Transit asset condition reflects the relative age of the region\u2019s transit infrastructure, as dictated by federally mandated performance measures. Vehicle condition (both for revenue and non-revenue vehicles) is measured by the vehicle\u2019s age relative to its specified useful life. Condition of guideway is measured by the share of miles that have speed restrictions due to aging infrastructure. Condition of passenger and maintenance facilities is measured by the share of facilities with a condition rating below fair, weighted by the monetary value of the facility.      DATA SOURCE Metropolitan Transportation Commission: Regional Transit Capital Inventory (RTCI)  CONTACT INFORMATION vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov  METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) Condition of revenue vehicles and non-revenue vehicles is evaluated based on the Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) specified by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Useful Life Benchmarks represent the estimated number of years that a vehicle can be in service and still be in a state of good repair, weighing the cost of maintenance against the cost of replacement. ULBs range from 8 years for automobiles and vans to 42 years for ferry boats.    Condition of guideway, or rail tracks, is defined as the percentage of directional route-miles with performance restrictions observed at 9:00AM on the first Wednesday of each month. Performance restrictions are defined as a speed limit on a segment of fixed guideway that is below the guideway\u2019s design speed, and can result from a number of causes, including defects, signaling issues, or obstruction due to construction or maintenance activities.  Condition of facilities is evaluated based on a five point condition rating scale developed by the FTA, known as Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM). Facilities with a condition rating of one or two are deemed to be out of a state of good repair. Facilities are evaluated based on a minimum of 10 criteria, including electrical systems, plumbing, interiors, and exteriors. Facility condition is weighted by assessed monetary value of the asset.   More information on federal performance measures for transit asset condition can be found on the FTA website. https://www.transit.dot.gov/TAM. transportation;health;demographics. Raleigh McCoy."

Child well-being matters for both ethical and economic reasons as children who flourish in the early years are more likely to become healthy, productive citizens later in life. This year\u2019s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development\u2014physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional\u2014 does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children\u2019s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.      <br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/d/sg6f-m5te </b></br></br>. politics;education;early childhood; child welfare; child development; early childhood education.

The following 34 \"investment packages\" were derived from recommendations in Corridor Mobility Plans for the nine corridors eligible for 2016 Mobility Bond construction funding in accordance with the ballot language approved by voters in November 2016. Those corridors are: North Lamar Boulevard, Burnet Road, Airport Boulevard, East MLK Jr. Boulevard/FM969, South Lamar Boulevard, East Riverside Drive, Guadalupe Street, William Cannon Drive and Slaughter Lane. The investment packages below equal an estimated $1.4 billion in mobility, safety, and connectivity improvements across the nine corridoes. The packages underwent a comparative analysis to identify the packages that would result in the biggest bang for the buck.     The packages were divided into two improvement categories: Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements and Enhanced Multimodal Improvements. Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements generally include the \u2018short-term\u2019 recommendations from the Corridor Mobility Plans. These provide improvements across all modes along the entire length of the corridors, including pavement rehabilitation, intersection improvements, traffic signal upgrades, transit signal priority, better connections to transit stops, continuous ADA-compliant sidewalks along the length of the corridor, continuous bicycle lanes or shared-use paths along the length of the corridors, and in some cases intermittent median islands for safety. Enhanced Multimodal Improvements generally include the \u2018long-term\u2019 recommendations from the Corridor Mobility Plans. While each corridor is different, and the specific improvements may vary, the Enhanced Multimodal Improvements are intended to bring each corridor up to the ultimate vision established in the Corridor Mobility Plan. These improvements build upon the Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements and add full street reconstruction, wider sidewalks, protected bicycle lanes, intermittent median islands for safety, and streetscape improvements, such as landscaping and trees.    Each package has three estimated costs: low, most likely, and high. The low represents the upper limit of the cost with a 10% confidence level, the most likely a 70% confidence level, and the high a 90% confidence level. This range is due to the level of information we have right now, and is typical of infrastructure project development.     City of Austin staff is proposing three approaches to funding the estimated $1.4 billion in projects: Full design and construction, Initiate Design and Possible Construction, Seek Additional Funding Opportunities. Full design and construction: Investment package will be fully funded through 2016 Mobility Bond funding and other partnership/coordination opportunities. Initiate design and possible construction: The City will start design of improvements in the investment package and the City will be seek funding and partnership opportunities to fund the project through completion. Seek additional funding opportunities: The City will seek to implement the improvements through partnership/coordination opportunities, and will seek additional funding opportunities.    All recommendations are approximate, proposed, and subject to change. The exact locations of improvements will be determined in the Project Design Phase, and the City will work with the community prior to project construction.. infrastructure;transportation;housing & development;corridors;pavement rehabilitation;traffic signals;bicycle projects;sidewalk projects;road projects;corridor construction program;2016 bond;2016 mobility bond. saradanae."

This process also assists our ability to work cross-departmentally and increases our resilience.    Why is the data inventory important?   \u2022 Stimulate new ideas and services. By publishing a data inventory, city departments may help to stimulate new and innovative ideas from the community.   \u2022 Increase internal sharing and resilience. A data inventory can also help us access information from other departments that we need to improve service delivery and resilience planning.   \u2022 Enabling better and more up-to-date processes. The process of publishing a data inventory will help us to realize the constraints of current City technology and processes, and then plan for future improvements.   \u2022 Changing how we use data. A data inventory can help empower us to change how we use, share and consume our data externally and internally, ultimately transforming data into better services for citizens and fostering continuous improvement.. city-data;city-of-new-orleans;data;inventory;open-data;."

First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform 3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date  Note that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process.   First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.   Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one.

Attention: The secretary of health extended health profession license expiration dates for licenses up for renewal between April 1 and September 30, 2020.  This extension allowed health professionals to focus on patient care and to promote continued patient safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also provided for a reduction in economic burden for those providers who could not work.  Health professional licenses that expired on September 30, 2020, and are in the renewal process, will be considered by the department as active until October 23, 2020. Renewal processing delays may occur in October, due to a high volume of renewals being submitted at the end of September.  Users of Provider Credential Search and our Health Care Provider Credential Data on this site are cautioned about using the Last Issue and Expiration dates reflected until renewal processing can be completed.   The Washington State Department of Health presents this information as a service to the public.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 142 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). This work is funded in partnership with the NOAA OAR Climate Observation Division.    The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion. The global sea level trend has been recorded by satellite altimeters since 1992 and the latest calculation of the trend can be obtained from NOAA's Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, along with maps of the regional variation in the trend.

VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise (EN11)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Share of population living in zones at risk from various sea level rise forecast scenarios    LAST UPDATED  July 2017    DESCRIPTION  Vulnerability to sea level rise refers to the share of the historical and current Bay Area population located in areas at risk from forecasted sea level rise over the coming decades. Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.        DATA SOURCE  San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission  2017  Sea Level Rise Maps  http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/    U.S. Census Bureau  1990-2010  Decennial Census  http://factfinder2.census.gov    U.S. Census Bureau  2015  American Community Survey  http://factfinder2.census.gov    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  Projected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data.     Because census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.    For the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available. More information on this approach is available here: http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/    Sea level rise analysis for metro areas reflects local, as opposed to global, sea level rise.

Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data.     Because census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.    For the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available. More information on this approach is available here: http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/    Sea level rise analysis for metro areas reflects local, as opposed to global, sea level rise. Recent data has shown sea level is rising faster in the southeast region of the United States. Regional differences in the rate of sea level rise. More information and data related to the rate of sea level rise for different coastal regions is available here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel-global-local.html. demographics;education;infrastructure;vital signs.

The data is collected in the New York Fire Incident Reporting System (NYFIRS), which is structured by the FDNY to provide data to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS).  NFIRS is a modular all-incident reporting system designed by the U.S. Fire Administration. After responding to an incident, FDNY officers complete one or more of the NFIRS modules, depending upon the type of incident. The information in these modules describes the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it.  Although NFIRS was designed specifically to understand the nature and causes of fire, as well as civilian fire casualties and firefighter injuries, it has been expanded to collect basic information on all incidents to which fire units respond.. emergency;fdny;fire;."

Examples of spending that does not count toward the $2,500 registration threshold include: payments made to a registered \u201ccontact\u201d lobbyist who directly contacts City officers; payments made to an organization for membership dues; payments made by an organization to distribute communications to its members; payments made by a news media organization to develop and distribute its publications; and payments made by a client to a representative to appear on the client\u2019s behalf in a legal proceeding before a City agency or department; salary paid by employer to employee for activities to solicit, request, or urge others to communicate directly with an officer of the City in order to influence a matter of local legislative or administrative action.  Each expenditure lobbyist must register by filing a registration form with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after qualifying as such, and prior to making any additional payments to influence local legislative or administrative action.  Each registered expenditure lobbyist must file monthly reports with the Ethics Commission by the fifteenth day of the month following the calendar month covered by the report.

SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)  #Grade 9 not in high schools  ##Indicates how special class is delivered    For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.     The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, \u201ccluster\u201d teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.. education;infrastructure;lifelong learning.

NEW YORK CITY Results on the NEW YORK STATE English Language Arts (ELA) & Mathematics Exams  (Grades 3 - 8)  2013 - 2015  Notes   Starting in 2013, the NY State Education Department (NYSED) changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm    Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for \"matched\" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, \"matched\" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th \u2013 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.  For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.  Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults    In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.
